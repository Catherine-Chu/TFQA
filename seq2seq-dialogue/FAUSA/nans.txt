Anytime. Good luck. Remember, ther number 1 train. The uptown platform.
You're welcome.
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink. Try this. It's size eight.

I'm taking too much of your time.
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.
I think it looks terrific on you.
It's ten after six. We're late. Robbie's cooking tonight,and dinner's at six thirty.

Tell me about it on the way home.
EOD2
How are you?

It's a surprise.

I'd appreciate that.
Thanks. Excuse me.
Where does she live?
Oh, that's not too far from here!
Thank you. I can only stay a few minutes.
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.
So, you're an exchange student. Where do you go to school?
Oh, that's a very good school. What are your favorite subjects?
Yes, a pediatrician.And what does your father do?
Would you like some pasta? I made it myself. It might be a little cold.
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday, so we can really thank you for bringing Richard's bag back.
You're welcome anytime.
Can I drive you home?
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.
Bye-bye.
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again, Right, Robbie?
EOD3
Good morning, Sam . What's the schedule today?
OK.
I did that. Go on.
Where are they?
Did you look at them?
What do you think of the spaceship?
Would you show me the drawings, please?
Now, what else is on the schedule today?
Where?
Hmm. Anything else?
Make sure everybody is at that meeting.
Oh, yes. Are his models here?
I'd like to see them.
What else?
You work hard, Susan. When was your last day off?
You really ought to take some time off.
To enjoy the simple things in life...
To smell the flowers.
Today is the twelfth. Why?
There's nothing else in the appointment book.
I hope it isn't important.
Right.
And the new drawings for the toy spaceship.
We have a new artist. She's very talented.
It's eleven thirty.
One 0'clock.
Did you remember your other appointment for today?
Yes, Sam?
What did I forget?
What? Who?
I remember! Oh... Harry! I made a lunch date with him and his daughter weeks ago.
He's a friend.
I met her at Thanksgiving, and I promised to have lunch with both of them today.
Any suggestions? Oh!
EOD4
Hello.
Daddy, can we go soon?
But I'm thirsty.
The fountain is over there, Michelle. Near the Exit sign.
Michelle is a little shy.
She'll be fine. Remember, I haven't dated anyone else since her mother died. This is a little difficult for her. Are you ready to go?
Sam, get Mr. Levine a Toytown Stores on the telephone for me, please.
Welcome to the South Street Restaurant, folks. What'll it be?
Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.
I'd love the crab salad.
OK, Daddy.
Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.
Where was that?
Sure. You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.
With a piece of meat on a string!
There you go.
And some ice-cold lemonade.
Enjoy it.
No, thank you, I'll wait for my father.
Sure.
You do? Susan
Because we like each other. And right now, he needs a friend.
I know you are.
And so are you, I think.
I'd like to be your friend, too. Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?
Just girl talk, daddy. It's too hard to explain.
EOD5
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park in a horse and carriage.
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you. It's so nice out. I decided to forget about my accounting problems and just enjoy this beautiful spring day. Take the time, Susan.
Right. Well, I had a really nice time.
So did I. I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.
Bye-bye.
Susan Stewart's office.
Hi. How was lunch?
You're late. The production department's waiting in the conference room.
Right.
Good for you. It'll be our secret.
OK, Susan. And have a nice afternoon.
She likes you.
How'd you do it?
About what?
And what did you decide?
EOD6
About what?
Oh.
We love having you here, and there is room, and...and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while.
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard. Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It's natural.
We looked at a lot of houses.
Oh, not at first. We couldn't afford it. Grandpa wanted to led us the money to buy one, but Philip is too independent. He didn't want to borrow any money.
They're all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He's independent, and sometimes just stubbom.
After Richard was born. I was teaching music, and Philip was opening his first medical office.
Right here in Riverdate. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us.
Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?
Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times. You'll learn a lot.
And a bank about a mortgage.
And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.
You won't believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one.
I think the skirt is just right. Are you planning to attach a train to it?
That dress is gorgeous.
And remember, we love having you here. There's no need to rush.
EOD7
I grew up in that house.
I've seen pictures of him. He had blond hair.
Well, we're not sure we can afford one.
That's a good idea. I love your house on Linden Street. I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.
Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room.
Mmm-hmm. So we will be needing more room.
No. But in five or six months...
Yes, it does. Well, when you called, you gave me enough information about your salaries and your savings. So I have a good idea about your financial situation. Let me show your some pictures of houses.
Yes, I think I can show you some. Of course, they won't be in Riverdale. The cost of housing's too high for you here.
Where should we look for a house, Mrs.Martinelli?
It's pretty, but I prefer a two-story home.
OK. Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners.
This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half- acre lot. You can probably afford this one.
So do I.
Yes. We're planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.
This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.
Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.
It's interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. Oh my! Here's a real buy. It's a bargain. This house just came on the market.
No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there's a two-car garage.
It's a good investment.
Thanks so much.
Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard. He took care of my daughter when she was a child. He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.
We really appreciate your advice.
Well, thanks so much for your help and your time, Mrs. Martinelli. We've got a lot to talk about.
EOD8
Hello.
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.
Likewise, Mr.Riley.
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.
Fine. Are you buying a house or are you reinancing your present home?
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.
I have some questions to ask. Do you own your house or do you rent?
And how old are you?
I'm thirty.
I'm a freelance photographer.
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.
Yes. Here they are.
We're talking about buying a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco. Here are the financial details on the house.
Yes, we are.
Yes.
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property? Any stocks or bonds?
I see. Then you don't have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor- someone to sign for the loan for you.
Since you don't have enough income, and you don't already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A guarantor is responsible for the loan if you can't make the payments.
Thank you, Mr.Riley. We'll read this over carefully.
Good-bye. Thanks.
I hope so, too.
Good-bye.
We have no collateral.
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.
We can get a loan from the bank if we can put up some collateral.
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.
No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.
What about the house in Mount Kisco? Somebody else'll buy it by then.
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.
This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn. Talking to the real-estate agent. Looking at the houses. Talking to the loan officer at the bank.
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time. Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind. You're talking about a lot of money.
And I'll call Mr.Riley at the bank and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.
We know.
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
EOD9
It's me, Grandpa.
And am I glad to see you! I am also glad to be here.
I have been talking to a group of salesmen since ten this morning, and I'm real exhausted.
He and Michelle are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.
It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa. We don't get to see enough of each other.
You don't need to do that, Grandpa.
I understand, Grandpa.
Grandpa, you have so much energy and so many years of experience. There are probably a lot of places for you to work. Particularly in the construction field.
Well, there must be something. Maybe I can help.
Sounds good to me. What are we having?
Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!
That's right. I've been thinking about it for weeks now .There must be some way to put my mind to good use.
EOD10
You sound like something's brothering you, Susan. The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?
Sure.
You need my advice on a personal matter, and it's not about. OK.
What's the problem?
I thought he was retired and pleased to be living with the family.
But what can I do? What kind of advice are you looking for?
He founded this company.
Right. Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.
Right. Then I've solved your problem.
I'm glad to help. Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?
Now, how's the Stewart family?
What's wrong, Susan? What's wrong with him?
Tell him to come and see me at ten 0'clock tomorrow morning. I have an idea that may solve the problem for him and help a lot of other people.
Sure can. Ten 0'clock in the morning. Here.
EOD11
John Marchetta. Sit down, sit down.
She says a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.
Call me John. May I call you Malcolm?
I understand you used to be in the construction business.
That is some history! You're a valuable asset, Malcolm. Very valuable.
Then you retired.
I understand. My daughter Cami lives in NewYork. I like being near her.
Sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Well, I'm evolved with an organization, and we're trying to resolve that problem.
TOPS. T-O-P-S- means Talented Older People's Society.
There are no dues...The organization serves major men and women like you. Experienced, talented, retired. But our members want to go out there and use their talents. They want to work.
I've got and idea for you, Malcolm. Just fill out this form for me. It'll only take a few minutes. Sit right here, and do it while I talk to my secretary. When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory. My company is a member of TOPS. So I try hard to find opportunities for people like it. Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now. Have you got time this morning to go over to the construction site with me? I'd like to have you meet my foreman-get some background on the job.
I'll be right back. We'll go over to the job site together.
My company was the contractor. I built the theater there with my own two hands, practically.
Well, I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well because Danny, Malcolm is on the TOPS team. He's going to be working with you for a while. His experience will be valuable to both of us.
I'm going back to my office. Give me a call later, Malcolm. I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting. I'd like you to meet the group.
No...thank you. And thank Susan.
A real inspiration for me.
Let me tell you something, Malcolm. With your background and experience, I can learn something...and I do need some advice on a difficult problem. Let me show you this.
You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm. Welcome aboard!
I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.
I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.
It's good to see you so happy.
I'm not doing anything. Why?
I'll accept. Tomorrow night. You and me. Dinner. What time?
I can't wait! And you can tell me all about your first full day back on the job.
EOD12
I am so excited, Mother! Just imagine-Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled! Oh, a new baby!
And my first nephew. Isn't he just adorable? He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.
I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.
Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today. Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes. The baby even looks at you like Richard does.
It's true Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways. And she's shy with new people, just like he is.
Yes. I'm very fond of her.
Well...
Where will we put all the presents?
The welcome sign is up
Your first great-grandchild.
I love you, Grandpa. You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.
Now you understand my feelings, Susan. I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart. He's always made me feel like his own daughter.
Mom, got it. This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and dates and information about Max's life here. Let's see. Name
Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart. Just Malcolm Stewart.
Uh, it must mean something.
Eight-six. Big boy! All the Stewart men were big.
And me?
Eight pounds six, just like me. That's nice. Length. Length?
Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.
I take after my mother's family. They were...they were... they were average.
Speaking of mother and of father-and speaking of Max hear the car. They're here!
Let's see. Oh, welcome home. Oh, let her in. Wait with your pictures for a second. Come on, darlings. Sweetheart... Sit down right here.
Max looks just like Grandpa.
I'm so happy to be home with my family-and with Max.
EOD13
I'll drive you to Grand Grandpa, Robbie, and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.
Did you see the washcloth and the towels with the teddy bears on them? Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for max.
The house is so alive with him here. The welcome sign over the door. The boxes of presents. The M-Z-X over his bassinet. Robbie put that there. Susan's teddy bear. So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.
Part of Grandpa's magic?
Part of Grandpa's magic?
The same baseball glove?
And then he takes it back when Max is ready to use it?
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he? So do I.
And so does Max.
EOD14
I hope you like it.
We really appreciate it.
Yes. I told Daddy to pick blue ones. Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.
He's a real Stewart.
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle. Especially to pick it out in blue.
Could she? Could we?
Take them upstairs, Susan. Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.
Come on, Michelle. Before Max wakes up.
Uh-hum.
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?
Growing up without a mother is difficult. You mature quickly.
Yeah. You can count on it.
I like him. He's good for Susan.
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.
You're right, Ellen.
It's the way it should be. The Stewarts are the Stewarts!
Right!
And now there's Max Stewart, and if he talks as loudly as he cries, we're all in for trouble.
Mmm-hmm.That's because he's sleeping.
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry. A baby gets used to voices.
And I didn't sleep well. Daddy told me. I never slept. And when I did, I woke up when I heard someone speak.
She sure was.
Oh, good. Now I can help diaper him.
You pick him up.
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering. You're a real Stewart.
EOD15
Oh, I love it. It's so convenient. I can take the bus to work...or the subway...or a taxi. And there's so much to do. Lots of movie houses, and the theater.
There's a lot of good things about suburban living. I grew up in Riverdale, Remember? So I know. But, as a working woman, I think New York has all the conveniences-including the best tomatoes.
You're right, Harry. Today is the perfect example. Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn. They come back here for lunch, then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History. There's so much for young people to see and do. It's just incredible!
Oh yes, Harry. My mother and father often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends. Dad was a busy doctor, but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in with Richard, Robbie, and me. I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
You ought to think about spending more time with Michelle at all the great places in the city.
Perhaps I will.
It looks inviting. I wish Michelle and her friends would get here. I'm starving, aren't you?
Michelle. It's us, Susan.
Susan, I really appreciate your doing this Michelle and her friends.
Thank you.
Well, it's...it's important for Michelle to see us together more often. That's true.
That makes me feel good.
Well, that you care about Michelle, that you care about me, and that you care about us.
They'll be here any minute .Susan, I'd like to continue this conversation later.
I'd like that.
EOD16
I'm so glad. Hi, Michelle, why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?
Hi.
Hello, Audrey. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper. I'm Susan Stewart.
Hi, girls.
The aquarium was so exciting. I had never been there before. The girls learned a great deal. Frankly, so did I.
We prepared some tuna fish and cheese sandwiches for lunch.
I remember when I used to b a Girl Scout. My mother would take us everywhere, too.
Yes, I am. My company manufactures toys and games for children.
And the marketing of new toys and games.
That's an excellent idea, Michelle. I happen to have a game which I brought home to study.
We tested it last week on twelve-to fifteen-year-olds, and they found it to be too easy-in other words...boring. We think it might be just right for ten-to twelve-year- olds.
First, you shuffle the deck and lay them face down. Then you select the leader. I'll be the leader. The leader takes the first ten cards and lays them face up on this stand. h-t-e-r-c-z-e-p-e-s. Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise, left to right. You have thirty seconds to make a word, using as many letters as possible. You get one point for each letter, plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra point. The first one to get one hundred points wins.
OK, let's go around the atble. You first, Audrey.
Good. That's five points also. It's your turn, Shirley.
Creep. That's another five-letter word. Five points. So far, you're all tied.
Sheet is a five-letter word. Michelle, your turn.
Terrific! Michelle wins with a six-letter word, plus she gets an additional ten points for a total of sixteen points. How are you enjoying the game so far?
Too easy?
It's OK, Harry Michelle is quite right. She just said it's too easy.
I enjoyed lunch, Susan. Thank you so much, but we have fo get going to meet the rest of the troop at two 0'clock at the museum.
Good-bye, everybody. Have a good time.
See you in front of the museum at five 0'clock.
Good-bye, Susan It's not a bad game. It's just... slow.
You are wonderful with kids.
Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?
EOD17
What was it about?
Oh?
Well, I do care about Michelle.
You know I do. You're a...wonderful friend.
Well...well, I do, Harry. It's only natural that if I care about Michelle and I care about you, then I care about us.
Like what?
What are you trying to say, Harry?
Don't be silly, Harry.
You're making the game harder.
Harry, I get it!
Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game?
It's such an important decision .There's so many things to talk about. There are three things that have to be done first, Harry.
First, we have to decide where to live.
All right. Second, we have to talk to Michelle together about being married.
You have to ask for my father's permission.
Oh, I'm so happy, Harry!
EOD18
Just because. How's the baby?
I'm sorry I missed him. I had to work late.
Five years of happiness. Happy anniversary.
I couldn't wait. Besides, we are not going to be here Saturday.
Where are we going to be?
The Watermill Inn. I loved that place when we went on our honeymoon.
I don't understand.
Oh, Richard! That's wonderful, bu-
Absolutely not. The world's greatest grandmother, Mrs. Ellen Stewart, has agreed to take care of him for the weekend.
Too much? She loves taking care of Max.
Well, we'll phone every hour, and you can listen o him over the phone. Come on. Mar. It's time you and I had a romantic weekend alone together. We've earned it. What do you say?
Great! I'll make a reservation right now. Remember that wonderful little balcony where we had our meals...with a view of the Hudson River?
Hello. Is Mrs. Montefiore there? Ah. She's out. Yes. This is Richard Stewart. My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the inn. No, we didn't leave anything in the room. It was five years ago. We'd like to make a reservation for this weekend. Yes, a double room, please. What? Are you sure? But...OK. Nothing available. Wait! Don't hang up! Can you recommend someplace nice-someplace nearby? Uh-hold it. Old country Inn? Right. And the phone number? 555-2420. Thank you. He says there's another inn just half a mile down the road from the Watermill. It won't be the same, But what do you say?
My mom is available to baby-sit this weekend.
Right!
Richard, that's the baby.
EOD19
Clean? You call this clean?
Thank you. I don't believe this. Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn, but let's get a look at the view.
Great, if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.
Sorry, Marilyn.
Well, the rain, the room, the view of the parking lot. It isn't the way I hoped it would be.
Is is for me, but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.
It's still raining. I want to play tennis.
Right. Would you give me room service, please? I beg your pardon! Oh, I see. They don't have room service at Old Country Inn.
They don't have a coffee shop .We can get our meals at Mrs. Montefiore's down the road.
Oh, you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn, but I think we should face the truth.
This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.
Why don't we get in the car and drive home?
Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?
Uh-hum.
Why don't we just check out?
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she. Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us! Yes, My husband did call. You do? Really? It won't be any trouble? Oh, yes, I think we'd like that very much. Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye. You will never guess.
Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.
They have an opening. Someone just checked out, and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us.
No. Isn't it wonderful?
EOD20
Oh, Richard, it's exactly as it was when we were married!
Even the old patchwork quilt is the same!
What a lovely tradition!
I remember you and your wife from the first time you stayed with us.
And very much in love.
How wonderful! A boy or girl?
Do you have a picture?
Oh, he's adorable!
Like his father. A real Stewart.
Well, it's nice to have you with us again. next time, bring the baby.
Not on our anniversary. This vacation is for you and me.
Oh, I took the liberty of ordering some breakfast for you. Just put it over there, Charles. Thank you, Charles. Compliments of the Watermill Inn.
Thank you so much.
Umm...smell that coffee... cinnamon and cloves.
Slices of orange with burnt honey.
First I want to call home and check on your mother and the baby.
She doesn't know we've changed hotels.
Hello, operator. I'd like to call Riverdale, New York.
This whole place is heavenly. Do you remember that old desk? Mrs. Montefiore told me that George Washington sat at that desk and wrote to his wife Martha.
Why don't we take a walk down to the river?
No. Look out the window. The sun is shining!
EOD21
Probably a lot of advertising and bills. Why don't you write to me, Robbie, so I can get some interesting mail?
Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie. Nothing interesting.
Oh, it must be a bill.
You're joking. Pete Waters?
Do I know Pete Waters? You bet I do! He was my roommate in college. He visited with Grandma and me in Florida about five years ago.
Yeah, he's fine. Just fine. He's writing to invite me to spend a weekend with him at his farm. He's planning a get-together with two or three other college friends. The dindof a fifty-year anniversary reunion.
It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.
I've never been three, Robbie, but he has chickens and cows and all. That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.
No, he doesn't fobbie. He never married. He's not as lucky as I am to have a family and grandchildren . I'm a lucky man.
That's a good question, Robbie. A very good question. He never married because the girl he was in love with in college married someone else. As simple as that. He never got over it.
Yes. Very much. Lillian Winters. She was in our class.
She was in love with Donald McGrath, the quarterback on our football team.
She liked Pete, and they went to dances together. But her heart was with Donald.
No, he never did.
I don't know. Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.
Pete's full of surprises.
With Pete, you never know, Robbie.
It is already. I'm kind of excited about going now. Next weekend...sleep over Friday and Saturday night and come back Sunday. I can't wait!
You're reading my mind, Robbie.
EOD22
Hi. Fill'er up. I need a full tank.
No, thanks.
Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.
How long is it going to take for me to get there?
No, I don't. Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?
That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.
OK. Let me repeat it. I take the next left turn to the stop sign. Then a right across a blue bridge, and then a big red barn.
How much do I owe you?
Well, here's a twenty.
Thank you. And thanks for the directions.
Hi. What can I do for you?
It is.
It's just over yonder. Keep along this road till you get to the end of the fence. You'll see the chicken. His house is on the left.
"have gone to the railroad station. Back soon with a surprise. Make yourself at home. Have a look around Pete." Same old Pete Waters. Always full of surprises.
EOD23
Oh, don't be silly, Arnie. Of course you recognize him. Except for the beard, he hasn't changed in fifty years. It's Malcolm Stewart!
Peggy-Peggy Pendleton! You're Peggy Pendleton!
I know who you are. You're Amold Franklin! I know who you are!
Sit down. Pete isn't home.
No. He left a note on the door saying he was going to the railroad station to pick up a surprise.
The two of you look unbelievable!
Yes. About four years ago.
Yup. Retired and moved to New York to live with my son and his family.
It could be most anything, knowing Pete.
So good to see you all!
Remember Lillian?
Lillian! Oh, my gosh!
Remember me, Malcolm?
That's OK, Malcolm. Donald Passed away a couple of years ago.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
And your little surprise, Pete? You really surprised me by having us all come together.
I've invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.
Our fiftieth reunion?
No. Pete wants to tell you...
For goodness sake, Pete, tell us! I can't wait much longer.
You don't mean to tell me that you and...
And I said yes.
Oh, Lillian, I am so happy for you both.
It's wonderful for me. Lillian will make me a happy man finally.
We are going to spend the entire weekend having a good time together here on the farm. We are going to celebrate all weekend.
That's another surprise. Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit. She's come here to stay.
Why, that's wonderful!
EOD24
I think I've got them.
Performing arts-performing arts centers. I think I've got them all, but I'm not sure.
Shubert Alley, center of the theater on Broadway.
You have been working on this for some time, Richard. I'm glad you feel you've finally put it all together. What now?
Oh, you think you're going to have a hard time getting the album published?
So, what do you think you're going to do?
Oh,yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.
So, why don't you call him in the morning?
I've been through every section with you, Richard. It's quite complete. And now that you're satisfied, with the performing arts section, I think you should show it to Mr.Carlson.
He's going to love your work. Come on. Let's get some sleep.
Seven after nine? No. I'm sure he's in his office.
Mr.Carlson is busy at the moment. May I help you?
And your name is...?
Mr. Stewart, I just spoke to Mr.Carlson. He would like to see you. But the only time he's available this week is tomorrow morning at ten 0'clock.
Oh, it's so exciting, isn't it, Richard?
EOD25
Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart. I'm here to see Mr.Carlson.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. In there?
Come in, come in. This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.
Sit down, sit down.
I hope you've brought your pictures along. I see that you have. Let's get right to it. We need a new coffee table book, and a book of photos about the United States still feels right. OK, let's take a look. Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A. It's an excellent title. If you had to describe the book in one sentence, how would you do it?
These are wonderful-these photos in your pen arts section. Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.
I do, but...
There's something missing. You've got a good eye, Richard. You're a terrific photographer. But before I can publish your work. I need to meet with my marketing department, and you've got to do one more thing.
In the section on culture, you've included performing arts centers, but you've left out street performance.The mimes. The musicians. The dancers-in the parks and on the streets. Richard, if you go out and photograph street performances in the city, you'll have it.
If you do it, I'll publish your work.
I've never been more serious. When do you think you can return with street performances?
If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.
Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.
When I way something, I mean it. Go to work. Goodbye.
EOD26
The pictures you've taken are fabulous, Richard. Mr. Carlson will love them.
I'm very proud of you. You really did a beautiful job. I know he will love the new photographs for your book.
Who?
Richard! I haven't brushed my hair.
Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!
Thanks.
Thanks!
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah. Thanks.
I'm so glad you like them so much.
Really?
Well...what do you think? Do I have my book?
Thank you.
When do you think we'll be through?
I can't wait to tell Marilyn!
EOD27
What's wrong?
Who's Carter Boswell?
What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?
Maybe it needs cutting.
Why does he want to do that?
He's probably right. Lots of people want their taxes used for new books and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.
Well, I'm not sure, Ellen. I hear it from my patients. Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.
Who's running against him?
Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell is going to win this seat on the board.
And how are you going to stop him?
Well, You've got my vote.
Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?
Hey, that's terrific, Mom!
Well, if I run for office, the voters will have a clear choice. I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.
Will you help me if I do run?
The trouble is it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.
Come in.
Yes, Charles Maxwell.
Hello. Please, sit down. You asked to see me. What would you like to see me about?
Well, I'm editor of the most influential newpaper in Riverdale. Actually, it's the only newspaper. A lot of people would like my help. Do you have a story?
Against Carter Boswell?
Well, that is news.
Sure. But I need some information.
Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell, Mrs.Stewart?
"Vote for Ellen Stewart.She cares." Not a bad slogan. But what do you care about?
Do you have a plan?
It's not a bad plan. But who's going to pay for all of this?
That's fair enough. Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs.Stewart?
Fair enough. I certainly can print the news. And you are now making news.
EOD28
Looks good. Simple.
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.
Good work, gang.
Mr.Nelson. Hi. This is Robbie Stewart. Did you know my mother is running for the school board?
Certainly, I'll give her your best wishes, Mr.Nelson.
We have done so much in such a short amount of time. I can't believe it! Wait till Philip come and sees our progress!
Mr. Maxwell was very kind to print my announcement.
Your photo in it helped, too.
Well, hi, all.
Hello, darling.
Licking envelopes.
We stuff them.
Hey, everybody, Mrs.Greenberg is on the phone. She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now-doing a commercial.
Five.
...and if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you. I care about the school buildings in need of paint. I care about more lockers for the teachers. I care about new fixtures in the hallways-not music or dancing or entertainment. I care about the practical things. If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.
I told you.
There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.
You have to go on television, too.
You can be, too. Your ideas are good ones.
EOD29
You were terrific!
Sure.
I like it, but now what? How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale will see it and hear it?
...I mean that when I say "I care". I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.
Mom is now on television in every appliance store in Riverdale, except Hamlin's. He's a Boswell voter.
You inherited your father's brains.
And guess what? I called channel five. Their TV news is going to cover it. "Housewife campaigns in appliance stores." And I'll bet some magazine will pick up the story, too.
Hold it, Robbie! Just cool down. I know we're getting some attention now, but in the end the voters will have to decide.
In the hotly contested race for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board, Mrs.Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.
Now returning to other local news...Riverdale High School beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today...
You're ahead. That's better than being behind.
It's not over yet. Let's just all calm down, and wait for the final results.
Thank you, Grandpa. I need some.
You came very close, Ellen.
I lost.
You lost by a very small number of votes.
There just wasn't enough time.
Hello. Oh, yes, yes, Mr.Maxwell.
How are you? I just called to tell you that you are very impressive. You lost the election, but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale, of Boswell, and of me.
I hear Boswell wants to appoint you to a special arts committee. I'm sending over a reporter in the morning to interview you.
I'm going to do an article on "Ellen Stewart-she cares. "Maybe we'll all care now. Good-bye.
What was that about?
And in this family.
EOD30
Hmmm. It is wrong.
The truth is...yes. I'll try again.
Not to worry. OK.Here we go.
If we can't tie the tie, then there can't be a wedding.
How're you doing, fellas?
No. I never could, either.
Yeah, Grandpa, I've seen you in it. You look great.How do you tie it?
You don't?
I never could tie one of those...things...bow ties. I have always worn a clip-on bow tie.
Of course. Now I remember.
We all need one of those.
Should be. Sunday's their big day.
Well, if they're not, I'll lend you mine, Harry. You're the only one who really needs to be wearing a tuxedo, anyway.
I'm the father of the bride. I'm supposed to be worried about my daughter, and here I am with the man that's marrying my daughter-worrying about him.
Are they open?
I'll bicycle down to the village and get them.
There's lots of time. A little over two hours.
And be a true member of the Stewart family.
Now, once you put the ring on Susan's finger, you are one of us, Harry. And don't ever forget it.
No, I think you put them in your tuxedo jacket pocket. Remember?
Didn't you give them to Richard? He's your best man. I remember. You gave them to Richard.
I hope they aren't lost.
I remember. I gave them to Robbie to hold so I wouldn't lose them.
It's still a little over two hours, Harry. Just relax.
I'm sure Robbie has them.
I'll hold on to them for you. The best man always keeps the rings.
Well, now, I think we'd better get dressed, fellas.
Robbie will bring the ties back.
You'll be fine.
Over?
I guess you're right. Two hours from now.Two hours from now.
OK. Let's see. Something borrowed. That's this dress. Borrowed from Marilyn.
Oh, Mother. I forgot you still had it. It's just so lovely.
And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?
All right. OK. Something borrowed.
The wristband. Something old?
Of course! Something old. I had planned to wear them.
Help me with them, Marilyn. I've never worn them before. I've been saving them for today.
Lovely!
Something borrowed, something blue. Something old... and now for something new.
You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.
Perfect!
Oh, I'm so excited!
That's all right, Susan. You've got the wedding-day jitters! In less than two hours, you will be Mrs.Harry Bennett.
Before you leave-do I look all right?
Mom.
What am I Supposed to do?
We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.
Are you kidding? Relax?
EOD31
Ah, Judge.
Hello.
All right, ladies and gentlemen. Please take your places. The wedding ceremony is about to begin.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Do either of you have any reason why you should not legally be joined in marriage? Is there anyone present who can show any just cause why these two people should not be legally joined in marriage? Then, Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart to be your lawful, wedded wife?
And you, Susan Stewart, do you take Harry Bennett to be your lawful, wedded husband?
The rings, please.
By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride now, Harry.
EOD32
Sure, what do you want?
That's easy. Walk to the comer. Then make a left turn. Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.Make another left to Wooster.
Yeah. A left. Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.
555-9470...and it's busy....Try again. 555-9470...and it's still busy. Excuse me ,ma'am.I'm looking for 83 Wooster Street.
Thank you, thank you!
Who is it?
Yes, it is. Come up. I'm on the top floor.
What pretty flowers! Thank you. Oh, please come in. Don't worry about being late. It's fine. Excuse the mess. I just moved here. Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in- law Marilyn. Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett.
Nice to meet you, Harry.
No,the restaurant will hold our table. I know the owner very well. I eat there a lot.
Sure. The number is... five five five... seventeen twenty.
I'm ready. See you later, Marilyn.
Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.
Thanks.
EOD33
Five, Somsak.And you?
This is my friend Harry Bennett.
Very nice to meet you. Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's. Follow me, please.
I do, too. I come here often.
Thank you, Somsak.
Would you like something to drink?
Do you have a dry white wine?
Chablis is fine.
I'd like the mee krob. Harry, would you like to see a menu?
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.
Oh yes. What do you recommend today?
Rose-petal salad?
I'll take care of everything.
What? Oh, yes. Starving.Well, I...
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?
Terrific!
That's true. Harry Bennett, Certfied public accountant. I love numbers. I do some work for Smith and Dale, your company's accounting firm.
Here we are.
I have a daughter.
She's nine years old.
Michelle.
She's very pretty.
Rose-petal salad. And there's a phone call for you, Mr.Bennett.
Please forgive me ,Susan, but...I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...
My daughter isn't feeling well.
I don't know.The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache, and she's crying. I'll have to go home. Will you forgive me?
Oh, it's OK. Let me take you home first.
It's our first date.
I'll phone you.
Good-bye.
EOD34
The baby-sitter called. His daughter is sick.
I think she has a stomachache. He's a good father.
He's very nice. But I think he was nervous tonight. It was his first date in two years.
I hope so.
He didn't get a thing to eat.
Who is that?
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!
Hi!
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.
I did, but everything is OK, so I decided to come back. To apologize for leaving so early, I brought you a little gift. It's a bonsai tree for your new apartment. Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.
Please, come in. Join us. It's our meal form the restaurant.And how is your daughter?
It's good that you went back.
I agree. Aren't you hungry?
There's lots of food left.
Enjoy!
Bye, Marilyn.
Good night, Marilyn.
You two must be close.
I like that.
You miss her.
Is there anyone else in your life?
Oh, I date occasionally, but my work keeps me busy.
Me, too, Harry. Harry?
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.
Of course.
Please do.
It was for a good reason.
What?
Good night, Harry. Have a safe trip home. Are you all right?
I never liked that umbrella stand. Good night, Harry.
EOD35
She went to a school-board meeting.
It's import to her.There are lots of places to go, lots of things to do. She can't sit around and do nothings to do. She can't sit around and do nothing. Philip works late.
Anybody home?
Oh. Hi, gang.
My day was just fine. So was my night. It's almost ten 0'clock. Mmm.I'm starving. Um...where's Mom?
There's a note for you on the refrigerator.
Did you have dinner, Robbie?
I don't have time to be exhausted.
Yeah, I feel bad about us not having dinner with the family, but our schedules are so different. Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork, or Mom is at a committee meeting. I frankly don't know what to do about it.
Well, I think I've had enough of that sandwich.
It's not good to eat before going to bed. A cookie can't hurt, though.
Well, good night.
Good night, Philip.
I found another mistake. I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.
I'm really concerned about them, Grandpa.
About Mom and Dad. They hardly ever see each other. Dad often works late, and Mom has all these committees she's on.
I don't know, but there must be a way of getting them to spend more time together. Quality time.
EOD36
Reading.
Things on my mind.
Sure, if you don't mind listening.
You haven't been around much lately.
You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night. Dad works hard, and he works late. You work hard on all your committees, and you work late.
I am, Mom. Real proud. You are one fantastic mom, but...but I've been noticing how little quality time you spend with Dad and me... and the family.
I'm concerned. There must be a way that Day and you can spend more time together.
I think you ought to take a vacation away from the family-alone. Kind of a second honeymoon.
I think I have an idea.
Yup. I think I have an idea that will bring Dad and you together in a more scheduled way.
Well, you know how Dad is always talking about the kids in the ward and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?
Well...and how hard it i because the doctors and murses are so busy?
Well, how would it be if you took some time to work with Dad towards solving that problem?
Like setting up a regular weekly reading program. You and Dad. You and Dr.Philip Stewart-going to the children's ward once or twice a week and reading to them.
What's that?
So it might fit in with a program for reading to the kids in the hospital.
But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work. Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?
You won't forget, will you?
Thanks, Mom.
EOD37
Good morning, Ellen. Yes, they do. That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee on the patio this morning. Ah, it does smell sweet. How was your school- board meeting last night? You must've come home very late.
Thanks, dear. I was so tired I didn't even finish it.
What is it?Ellen
Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.
Mostly watching television. Well, that would be OK if , and I repeat, if people took the time to read.
The question is, how do we get them to read more?
I do have an answer, Philip. Or at least I think I do.
The plan is a simple one. Involve the entire family in a reading project.
Yes, in the home. But first in the school-rooms.
By arranging with the public schools to schedule one hour a week-to start with. During that time parents are invited to attend-and to read along with the children- their children.
Really?
You think so?
May be we can experiment with your patients and see how the plan works.
I would love to, Philip.
You and I are very busy these days. This is true. We need to find time to be together more, to do things together more-you and I. This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.
Yes?
To the patients in the ward?
Well, let you and I talk about it. What would you like to read to them?
It's called "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."
All right. "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"by Robert Frost.
He gives his harness bells a shake
You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!
Dad...Robbie. When did you come?
Do you enjoy reading together?
You were right, Robbie.
EOD38
Turn around, Michelle. Let me see the back of it. I like it a lot. It fits well. It doesn't need any alterations. We must've bought the right size.
I like blue, too, Daddy.
OK.
And I've never been happier, Harry. I love her very much.She's been a joy.
We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?
Well...? Could we ask for anything more?
How do you like it, Daddy?
It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.
Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans, and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.
What did you mean by"well...?" You had something on your mind when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.
Everything is fine, Michelle.
It's kind of warm.
Looks like we should've bought a bigger one. I guess we'll have to exchange it, too. I'm sure the store has others.
You're growing so fast, Michelle.
Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles. I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles.
I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.
I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue. I do his taxes every year. He has a big sales office in Los Angeles, and the company in Los Angeles that does his major accounting work is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.
Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.
The real discussion comes tomorrow. Susan, I don't plan to make any decisons until I have a chance to talk with you about it.
And I don't have to make a quick decision. They know that I'm married and that I have a family.
Is everything OK?
EOD39
Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn't.
A real dilemma.
Yes, but I don't know where to start.
Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down, Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.
There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle. I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job. I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles. And what about our family?
Tell me.
I suppose I could call him. But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York, you, and the rest of our family.
If moving to L.A.is in Harry's best interest, I have to do what I can do to support him.
And what about Michelle?
I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.
I don't know for sure.
I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta and get his feelings about my leaving. And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.
I'll call him right now. No point in delaying. Thanks.Grandpa.
It's a big decision for me, Bill. And I have to discuss it with my wife. I don't know if it's right for her.
OK. Tell it to me again.
I know the company well. It's big.
Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?
When would we have to move?
I also have my daughter to consider. I don't want to interrupt her school year.
I know.
Yeah, I know. The biggest.
I met with Bill York today.
Yup. He asked me if I want the job.
A vice-presidency with the biggest accounting company in th country-Craft and Craft.
Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.
What did he say? Did you tell him about me?
You're kidding.
Unbelievable!
You're right. We'll talk to her about it.
How should I feel? It's the biggest company in the country.
Well... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?
EOD40
Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle. I'd like to talk to you about something. Something important.
Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle. But your dady and I are talking about something that I'd like your opinion about.
You're right. How do you feel about it?
But?
That's very considerate of you, Michelle. But what about your friends?
Honey, we don't have to move if you're no going to be happy about it.
I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.
Michelle was chosen to do the school poster for the play this year.
I see you're in a good mood. Why don't you tell us about your day.
It's OK to talk about it, Harry. Michelle knows all about it.
Really, Harry. Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings about leaving New York, the family, and friends. But is you think you should take the job, we're behind you.
We'll move after the school term.
I'll make new friends wherever we are as lon as we're together.
I am so touched. The two of you are really something.
And I love you.
Nope.
No? You didn't take it?
But, Daddy, I thought...
Or me?
How's that?
And?
Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?
Are you sure?
I'm glad if you are, Harry.
Your favorite people?
The Stewart family, of course.
EOD41
Hi, Marilyn. What are you doing?
I never stop thinking about them.
I see.
I really understand, Marilyn, But you never have to worry about Max. There's Mother and Grandpa...and I can always arrange my photo schedule around your schedule, if that will help.
Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?
Ah! That's what's got you thinking, isn't it?
And you said...?
I'm sure Rita Mae will understand and wait until you're ready to go back to work.
That's something to consider. You've got yourself to think about, too.
What do you mean?
I never really thought about being a mother as a career. I guess you do have two career opportunities and a decision to make.
I'll go to him.
EOD42
He just loves that teddy bear that Grandpa Philip bought for him.
Oh, did he cry?
How did you feel? Tell the truth didn't you feel terrible?
Helped him? Or helped you?
Speaking of being a mother, I've been meaning to ask you what you were thinking about regarding going back to work. I know Rita Mae called. I can imagine what is going through your head.
There are so many things to consider. One thing that makes it easier for you is that you have us. Max will always have a family member to watch over him while you're at work. I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.
I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher. We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan, and I continued with my career.
I think I did. But when Robbie was born, I decided to give fulltime attention to raising Robbie. I felt differently at that time.
Not exactly. I continued to teach piano lessons at home.
I think I did the right thing for them and for myself and for Philip. We needed the money. Remember?
I can't wait till he's just a little older. Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.
Hello. Hello. I miss Max and think about him all week long. We talk about him at dinnertime.
You seem to be enjoying the pressure.
That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.
Marilyn's career.
Choice?
Why does it have to be one or the other?
How's that?
She's right.
Well, that's what I do. I have a job, and I have Michelle. I take care of both to the best of my ability. It's not easy, but what is?
I thought you stayed home with Robbie?
Why can't you work at home, Marilyn? You're very talented. Designing dresses is a career you could establish out of your home, couldn't you?
And you could make your dresses at home.
That could solve your problem, Marilyn.
I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn. You can do it.Do your designs at home-here.
And you can both benefit financially.
Are you kidding? I don't mind at all. As a matter of fact, I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.
I don't know what I would do without you. I'm lucky to have you all.
And so is Max.
EOD43
That must be Rita Mae.
I think she's just anxious to see Max. She loves children.
Welcome. It's so nice of you to come.
Hello, Rita Mae.
I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.
I remember. How are you?
Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae! You shouldn't have.
Can I get you some coffee or tea a cold drink, Rita Mae?
Well, I will leave you two to talk. Come on, you big guy. Yes, come on. That's it.
Thanks, Ellen.
OK, Marilyn. You sounded like you've made a decision when you called me. I'm all ears.
I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision. If I had a child as cute as Max, I might do the same thing.
The other half?
Sounds interesting. Let me hear it.
I sure do.
And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.
Oh! What kind of dresses would you design?
Yes?
Wedding dresses? Brilliant idea! There's a big market today in wedding dresses.
I like the idea very much. And if it's successful, we can expand to all kinds dresses.
As a matter of fact, I have a customer for your first wedding dress. My niece is getting married, and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her. Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. That'll be our first one, and then we'll use it to sell others.
I really mean it. It's a simple idea, and it will work. You can certainly design dresses. I know that. And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.
If I had a baby like Max, I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too. You're making the right decision for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.
Now the hard work begins.
I'd love to . Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful! Ooh...
EOD44
The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset. Ah! I'll read it to you. "The old library building on Chestnut Street, which has been vacant for over a year now, was supposed to be made into a community center to serve the senior citizens as well as the younger people of Riverdale. Due to lack of funds for the repainting of the interior of the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been postponed indefinitely." He's coming over to talk about it.
It is. Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie. He doesn't have any family with him. He lives alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people- people hi own age.
It's small, and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play. Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.
It's hard for some older people to take all that noise. That's why the new community center is a good idea. Part of the building for older people, part of the building for younger people.
That must be Nat.
Hi, Robbie.
I'd love some cola, please.
You're so good in all your other subjects. I just can't understand why you have so many problems with math.
Hi, Mr. Stewart.
No problem, Grandpa. We're just having some cola before getting to tough stuff- math.
I was the same way.
Really. I didn't like math, I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it.
I was. But not in high school. For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it. Then, in college. I became good at it.
I can't wait. You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college?
That must be Nat.
I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker. This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie, whom I think you've met once twice before.
Hi, Mr.Baker. We met before.
In town. At the hardware store.
Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring. Robbie. I know you want to get to it.
I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math.
I did.
It is. Come on out to the patio. We'll talk about it out there.
What's the problem?
EOD45
It's certainly a good idea. If I could take a look at the place, I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up. How much paint, how many hours of work...
I'll help too, Mr.Baker. I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood and collect the furniture we need.
Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.
I'd really like to.
We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie. Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture, but to help with the paint job. That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.
And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?
I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart. Malcolm, this Joanne Thompson
My pleasure, Malcolm.
Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.
Malcolm, please.
Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee. And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.
I thought so, too. I'm surprised they're not here. Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra. Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but...
I understand you used to be in the construction business, Malcolm.
I wonder if you would take a look at the old library and make sure that it is in good condition so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.
We've got permission to go inside the old building during the week-Tuesday or Wednesday.
That would be very helpful.
And a good paint job.
I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting. They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.
OK.
As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.
That's an idea I like. A community center with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.
It's asking a lot. But we can't do it without talking to the young people. Finding out what they want.
Don't be upset, Malcolm. We'll have a chance to talk to them later.
EOD46
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell. This is Nat Baker, who's responsible for this meeting, and this is Joanne Thompson-and Abe Lucas, who used to run the drugstore in town.
Let's go. What are your questions?
OK, what do you need most of all?
To do what?
So that we can repaint it.
That's right. And we'll also need some ladders and some brushes and some paint.
I've got the council to agree to open the building for us on the next four weekends.
Yes. Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.
That's right.
I've got it. Now give m some information about how you see the building being used.
It's here, Robbie. Charles Maxwell lived up to his word. "At the Stewart family home on Linden street yesterday, a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered to plan the refurbishing of the old library to transform it into a new community center. The original plan by the council was tabled because of lack for funds.The new plan needs you . You could call it a community unity plan. It needs your time, and it needs your energy. And it needs your contributions of furniture, paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera. A list of these items and a volunteer form can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices. By working together, this community can do anything to benefit its citizens, and we know you will all work together towards refurbishing the old library and making it a new community center. Charles Maxwell, Editor."
EOD47
Hi, Robbie You're home from school early.
Well, now that you're here, you can help me with dinner. I need those potatoes peeled and sliced.
Well, in that case, you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner.
Of course.
You an Alexandra have become good friends, haven't you?
Would you like to give her a little farewell party?
Oh, I don't know. Surprise parties don't always work out.
Well, I suppose that might work.
Fine.
What's that?
I'm sure Alexandra would be happy with something simple, Robbie.
It's all right with me if it's all right with your dad.
I think so.
Robbie! Good luck!
Oh. Thank you, Molly. Now, let me check them.
I don't see any breaks or fractures. Well, well. Thank you, Molly.
Come in! Hi, Son.
No, no, no, no,. What's up?
Sure.
Well, that's what fathers are for.
Yes...
And What sort of job?
Sounds pretty good.
Who isn't?
Nice girl. We'll all miss her.
Good idea.
What'd you have in mind?
Sounds fine, Robbie.
Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it. When do you need the money?
You've got it.
My pleasure, Son. Oh, and, Robbie...
You'll probably want the family car so you can drive her home after the party.
If you drive carefully.
My pleasure.
You're not so bad yourself, Son.
EOD48
You know what? I can't look at another number. How about a lemonade break?
Oh, by he way, when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?
Would you be able to come over Saturday night?
My folks are giving me a little graduation party.
I'll pick you up.
My dad's letting me borow the car.
About eight 0'clock?
Great! It's a date.
Just my friend Mike and a few kids from school.
We're going to miss you.
I'm counting on it.
Sure...and a little scared.
Aren't you a little scared?
I'm glad I got to know you.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations and get right to the graduation party?
Good night, Robbie. Good night, Mrs.Stewart. Thank you for dinner.
Yes.The Molinas are waiting for me.
Yes. Eight 0'clock.
Good night, Robbie. She's really a good friend, isn't she?
You are going to miss her.
That's what I said! You are going to miss her!
Well, you can write to her.
How does that look, Rob?
You got it!
Absolutely. She has no idea that the party is in her honor.
They're in my bag.
Some rock 'n' roll.
What about the cake?
Robbie, there's a phone call for you. It's Alexandra. She sounds upset.
EOD49
No, let's wait till Robbie gets back from the airport.
She told Robbie that her flight tomorrow was canceled, so she had to take an earlier flight today.
Well, that must be him.
I don't know. Maybe he's angry.
Too late now. We should have done it sooner. Oh, here he comes.
OK, I guess. Especially when Alexandra gave me a surprise...
This!
Hi! What happened?
That's great! Terrific!
Well, Robbie told me when he gave me this.
It's lovely, Robbie.
No. Would you mind? I'd like to say something first.
I should just like to thank all of you, my friends, who have made my stay in the Unite States so wonderful. And to Robbie and the Stwart family for opening their home to me.
And I also have a little surprise for you, Robbie. A little going-away present.
Open it, please. I think you might be amused.
I guess we were thinking the same thought.
Read it, Robbie.
All right! Let's have some music!
Mr.Stewart...
My pleasure, Doctor.
EOD50
Hot dogs and mustard.
Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach?
We'd wait until dark and make a fire, and we'd cook the hot dogs. Oh, don't forget the mustard. And, oh, does anybody want ketchup?
I'll remind you, Richard.
I love doing it. Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city, and I'm taking care of Max. It's no big deal. I am happy to do it for you.
Oh, poor baby. He's teething.
He'll be fine, Marilyn.
I'm really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen, and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max. Especially with his teething. I wish he felt better.
I agree, Marilyn. We really don't have to be overly concerned.
Thanks, Richard. Try putting him across your lap on his stomach. He likes that.
When are Susan and Harry Picking you up, Marilyn?
That's nice. And you'll have a full day in the country.
And coming home on Sunday?
You're going to have the time of your lives. Camping out is such great fun.
It will be my great pleasure, Marilyn. Remember, it's only one night.
Thanks, honey. I hope he's good when we're away.
It's in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers.
No.No bottle opener. Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing?
Matches.
Yes, of course. For when we build our campfire. I can't build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together.
All packed and ready.
Oh, that's a nice idea. An audio diary.
Got it! The cassette player and the tapes.
EOD51
I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years.
That's what I love about Susan. She works hard. She plays hard. She's a real Stewart.
Where does it go?
Oh, there's our table and benches. All set for eating.
Is anybody hungry?
We just got here.
I sure am. How about you, Richard?
You guys are like three kids.
Well, yeah. Now that you mention it, I guess I am. I mean, how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?
Right here, next to the ice packs. Here. Put the tablecloth on the picnic table, and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.
I've never been more relaxed.
I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry. She would have loved it.
Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max. We're having a good time, and they're in good hands.
I am having a good time, Harry. I promise not to think about the city. We're in the country. Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place and this wonderful weather.
This is heaven, Harry! It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.
Like it? I love it! Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us. It's so calming.
We've only been here for a day, and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems. The office seems so far away.
And next time we'll bring Michelle, I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.
Just listen to the sound. It's so soothing.
Wouldn't it be wonderful?
It puts you to sleep. So does the sound. I've bee having a hard time keeping my eyes open just listening to it. It's like a special music.
But we can!
Bottle the sound.
Oh, yeah? Great idea! Let's do it!
EOD52
What did I tell you? Nothing to worry about.
Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off. We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.
Something wrong?
Neither can you.
Oh, I'm fine. How was your weekend?
It was wonderful. The weather couldn't have been better.
Did you get a chance to get outside at all?
Harry's a professional camper, Mom. He knows all there is to know, and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.
You were wonderful, Harry!
Oh, I'm fine. Tell me more about your weekend. Did you do anything special?
And we brought some home for you. It was so nice to be out in the country.
Everything smelled so special. It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.
Oh!
I'll take care of it. Let's see if it works.
A little we'd better head home. It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.
Oh, thanks, Harry.
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.
I'm so tired I think I'm overtired. I don't know if I can get to sleep.
Yes. It works!
What works?
Oh. Oh, where did you get that? It sounds so nice. I think I'm falling asleep.
Good night.
EOD53
Is this OK?
I like it there.
I can't believe this is really happening!
I know, but it's still a dream come true.
Are you worried?
When do we see the reviews?
So do I. Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book to buy a new house.
Speaking of promoting the book, do I really have to autograph copies for the guests at the opening?
I feel uncomfortable about it.
Couldn't we wait until I'm famous?
No, I think this one belongs in the "people-at-work" section.
Right.
Nervous? Me? No. I'm scared to death.
Well, my family, I guess. My wife Marilyn, my father and mother, my brother Robbie, my sister and her husband and their daughter. And my grandfather. Is that too many?
I hope they like it.
Everybody. But especially my family. They've stood by me through all this.
Harvey, how are you?
Well, you're the young man who did all this.
Nice to meet you.
Mitchell has always encouraged new talent.
Be our guest.
What does that mean when he goes, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,mm-hmm"?
I don't care what the critics say, Mr.Stewart. Your work is brilliant.
Tom is studying photography at NYU. He's working with me during the summer months as an intern.
It's not good enough to show. I'm still learning.
If you really mean it, I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.
Very interesting pictures, Mr.Stewart. You have a most unusual eye.
It is.
Oh, yes. It's definitely worth reviewing.
Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey. I'd like an advance copy of the book, though, so I can study it.
Just follow me, Mr.Johnson.
Do you think he liked my photographs?
EOD54
I love it.
It's beautiful.
I know. I know. Help me with this tie, will you? Honey, I'm scared to death.
No, no. I worked to put together a book of photographs. This is show business.
You're right. I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it. As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.
Everything. A critic was there this morning. He probably hates my work. I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people I never met before. My new shoes hurt my feet...
As soon as I get these cuff links on.
There! You look very attractive.
Mm-hmm. Let's go...
Thanks. Now, no more stalling.
There's nobody here!
Oh. Right.
Well, thanks. This is my publisher. Harvey Carlson. You've met my wife Marilyn...
Hi.
It's good to meet you.
This is my father, Dr.Philip Stewart...
My brother Robbie...
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Welcome, Mr.Stewart. Well, make yourselves comfortable. There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar. Help yourselves. Can I get you something, Mr.Setwart?
You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr.Stewart.
Of course. Feel free to look around. If you need anything, just ask.
Harvey?
Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet?
Thanks.
Yes. Have the people arrived?
EOD55
Read it.
"Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery is a collection of photographs from his new book entitled Family Album, U.S.A. There is power and beauty in. Mr. Stewart's work, and his book introduces us to a remarkable new talent." Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!
Wow! I'm overwhelmed.
Hello. I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight. I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson for his faith in my project. But most of all, I would like to thank my family for their love and support all through this adventure. Thank you.
Would you mind?
Thanks.
I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.
Oh,how do you do ?
I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart. I'm really impressed by your show.
In fact, I'd like your autograph.
On a contract.
Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines.
Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.
I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.
It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.
What's the problem, Richard?
I understand, Richard.
Thanks.
Thanks.
EOD56
Coffee, please.
When does he arrive?
By plane?
Are we picking him up at the station?
Huh.
Great! Let's do it!
Morning.
Hello.
Hi, honey.
We're going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room. There's coffee ready.
Me, too. Milk, please.
I think he will. It just takes time to fell comfortable in a new place.
Will, he will. But I think he'll like being here with the family.
But it's fun.
You know, maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa as a "welcome" present.
Oh, I remember this picture.
Railroad stations or airports-Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?
What's inside?
Hi.
Morning, Philip.
We are, too.Susan called early this morning. She's unhappy and can't leave till tonight. She wants to be here for Grandpa.
Fine.We were just wondering about this trunk.
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.
EOD57
No, it's not taken.
Oh, let me help you with this.
Do you want to sit by the window?
My name is Stewart...Malcolm Stewart.Pleased to meet you.
Do you live in New York?
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?
Titusville.It's near Orlando.
Really? What part?
I know that area. My house is only a few miles from Spaceport. Do you still live there?
No.I sold the house and the furniture, put a few personal things in an old trunk, and shipped it to my children in NewYork. That's my desination.
My wife died four years ago.She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.
Lots of wonderful memories. We were married almost fifty years.Well, forty-seven, to be exact.
Oh, congratulation! That's nice. What does John do?
I just retired. Had my own company. A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff. But I just sold it and retired.
Would you kindly hold these keys, please? I have a ticket, I know. I was in the smoking section.
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs.Tobin.
And here are your keys.
Do you have family in New York?
Yes,indeed. A son and his wife and their three children-my grandchildren.
I can't wait, to see them!
Yes.
Well...they want me to, but it's too early to know for sure.I'm pretty independent. I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence, but I'm not sure I want to be alone. Some people don't mind being alone.I do.
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family. I didn't want to be alone anymore!
EOD58
Well, here we are .It was so nice meeting you, Mr.Stewart.
Your son?
And don't be so independent. You're very lucky to have a caring family.
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon, and we'll take your dad with us.
That's a great idea, Grandpa! Philip needs a day off.
Form me and Marilyn.
Richard, these are terrific pictures. This one really brings back memories. You remember that day, Robbie?
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here. I miss her very much.
I can't wait to see her. She looks just like Grandma at that age. I'd better unpack.I started traveling twenty-four hours ago. I'm not so young anymore.
No, thanks.After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.
Pleasant dreams.
I have the key, but it doesn't work.
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!
Lots of interesting information about ur family.A gift from me.
Grandpa! Grandpa! Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.
I don't feel alone anymore.
EOD59
Your new exercise class?
Why advanced?
Too easy for you?
So?
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes without stopping. No problem.
Yeah.Quite a bit different.I think aerobics. I could work out in your class with no problem.
Oh, without a duobt. When's the next class?
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights, I'll try aerobics. It's a snap. Tomorrow morning at ten 0'clock.
Of course. Easy. No sweat.
Are you kidding me? It's going to be a piece of cake. You want to bet.
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing!
It's a bet.
Well, it's eight twenty now.
Davis Aerobics Centrer for Good Health.
This is Jack Davis.
Oh, fine,fine.Be here a few minutes early.You need to complete some forms before the class.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Don't forget about the bet. Dinner for the entire family. And that includes Susan.
EOD60
Six months ago.
Nope. I am in perfect health.
I'm a photographer.
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.
No...I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.
Sure.
When can I photograph a class?
How about today?
Hi.
Are we ready to go?
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics calss today?
What is wrong with you?
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really?
Hurt? What do you mean?
Nope.
EOD61
Don't forget Susan.
Marilyn, I have to tell you something. At today's exercise class...
Well, I didn't really exercise.
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer. I'm sorry, Marilyn.
No.Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.
No.
What about the bet?
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.
Don't forget to breathe.
This is fun.It's a piece of cake.
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back, 3, 1, 2, 3, pony, pony...1, 2, 3, kick...1, 2, 3, kick...pony.And twist, twist.
How are you doing, Richard?
2,3,4,front.Now we're going to run it off. Front...knees up, knees up.
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.
Come on, Richard.Get up. Let's go, you have to cook dinner for the entire family.
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.
Yes,it is.
It's true. You are in Great shape.
I think we'll cook dinner together.
Hi, Robbie.
Yes, indeed. Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator, and I'll make you two fried eggs.
I made enough for an army. You going to the baseball game today? It's a perfect day for it-a little cloudy but nice and warm.
Do you have any other plans for the day?
Maybe you can teach me how to work on a computer someday.
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?
Well,maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.
But what?
Well,can you come fishing with me tomorrow?
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today.
I understand.
Definitely.We should. You and Robbie and me. Remember our first fishing trip?
Going fishing?
Oh,the usual problems.
I guess I am.
I remember exactly. It was on his birthday, June second,two years ago. We didn't catch anything.
Yes.I loved them.
How can I forget? I fell out of the boat! we had some good times together.
How about tomorrow?
My paper work will wait.
I want to spend more time with Robbie.
Well, what's the weather going to be like?
Well, I'll tell Robbie. And thanks, Dad.
EOD62
First, we have to catch some fish. In order to catch fish, you have to do this. Here we go. that's it. Then drop it into the water. All of this comes before eating. OK?
Grandpa taught me. We spent a lot of time fishing together. Now, the important thing is to get the book close to the fish. All right? Like this.
Oh, not a chance!
Hi, there!
What's your name?
Are you all alone?
How old are you , Albert?
Where's your father?
Does he know you're here?
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him. The water's pretty deep here.
What time is it?
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.
To catch fish, you need the right magic.
You remember?
Well,first, you have to turn your hat around like this. Then you close your eyes and say the magic words. Fish, fish, send me a fish.
See, it works!
Well, it always worked for me, too.
Dad, you got one, too!
Easy, Philip, easy.
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.
Robbie's right.
I want to stay here and fish.
Is it finished yet?
Burned, you mean.
Help! Help! I can't swim.
Easy does it ,Robbie.That a boy. That's it.
Robbie, run to the car.Bring a blanket and my medical bag.
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.
Here's the bag. Will he be OK, Dad?
I want my daddy!
Your dad is quite a guy.
How is he ,Philip?
How can I thank all of you?
I'm very grateful, Robbie.
I'm so thankful to all of you.
He's a lucky boy.Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?
That's OK.
You didn't ruin my day, Dad. I understand. I really do.
Philip had to go back to the hospital.
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie. Did it spoil your fun?
Well, did you do any fishing?
Oh, you really had a bad day.
And Dad saved his life. He's a terrific doctor,Mom.
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.
What a day!
I'd love a cup of coffee..
She'll be fine.
No.
Well, it's hard work.
I had a good time today, Robbie.
Can we? When?
Won't you be busy?
We sure do, Dad. Grandpa, can you come?
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
EOD63
I guess we must.
OK.The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples
Now, the ingredients.
If there is any cinnamon,it's in the cabinet with the salt and pipper.
Yes,Philip.
Yes,it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.
Oh, hi, Robbie.Good morning.
Sure, Dad.What?
No. The sssss...
Right.We don't have any cinnamon.
That's my boy!
Alexandra might call. Tell her I'll call her right back.
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.
Here's your cinnamon, Pop. It was a dollar and sixty cents.You forgot to ask me for the change.
Alexandra called.
She said she'll call you later. She's not at home.
She said she'll call back?
Good morning, everyone! Happy Turkey Day? What's wrong?
What's gotten into him?
From...?
It's nice to see young love... Oh, to be young again! Where's the coffee?
EOD64
It's for kids.
Hello, hello... Oh,hi, Susan. How are you?... Here's Mom.
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing. It's delicious.
It's my favorite part of the meal.
Dad,your apple pie is my favorite dessert.
OK.
No, Robbie.
Wrong number. Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please? It's getting late. We have vegetables to prepare.
No, honey. You just relax with Grandpa.I'll get you to help serve later.
What time does the Michigan football game come on?
Philip!
Grandpa,when did Dad graduate from Michigan?
did you go to Michigan, too,Grandpa?
I've got to start thinking about college soon.
EOD65
Thank you, Dr.Stewart.
OK.
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play about the first Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims, the first settlers in America. They shared the first harvest with the Indians and gave thanks.
All right! We love you, Grandpa.
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan and the Stewart family.
Thanks, Harry. That was very kind of you.
Oh,Robbie!
I'm thinking. You go first.
Thanks, Richard. I should thank you for encouraging me to keep working on my fashion designs I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.
I'll go along with that, Ellen.
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart. Thank you.
Exactly.
Remember, the Michigan football game? And Michigan needs a touchdown.
Dad, your famous apple pie.
Go ahead, Philip.We should all take a little break before dessert.
You did?
You know everyone, Alexandra.
Nice to meet you.
Hello,Alexandra.
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.
Michigan needs a touchdown. Three minutes to play. Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.
You want Michigan to win.
What happened?
We did? Philip, why don't you go watch the last three minutes of the game.I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.
Robbie,would you bring the dessert plates. And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?
I'm glad you came by , Alexandra.
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!
Oh, Grandpa!
EOD66
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.
Is something wrong, Alexandra?
Yes, there is. I can tell. What's the matter? Come on, you can tell me .What's up?
OK, let's talk.
Did they write some bad news?
Well, then why are you so sad?
I'm sorry. Alexandra. But I understand.
You really miss your family, don't you?
Hey, why don't we go out for a cheeseburger and French mes? That'll cheer you up. And you can use my Walkman.
So do I.
Do you hear something?
It sounded like a dog barking.
Yeah.
A sprinel! Come on in! Make yourself at home.
Come on.
Where did you come from?
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.She's so cute.
The number's no longer in sevice.
We'll find them. Don't worry, Alexandra.
EOD67
How, Robbie?
Gemma, sit. Good Gemma.Give me your paw.Good Gemma.This dog is well trained.
Robbie, let's call them.
Hello, ASPCA.
We're open till nine P.M.
Thanks. Bye.
They're still open?
I hope so. I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.
I'd like to keep her, too. But I'll be going home to Greece at the end of the semester. She just wants love and affection.Come on, Robbie. Let's get her to the animal shelter, so they can find her owners quickly. Don't worry, Gemma. We'll get you home. It's not easy being away from home.
Your name?
Your name will do, Mr.Stewart. Your address?
Where did you find the dog?
You tried calling the number on the collar?
And there's no address on the dog tag?
No ID number. Without that, it's hard.
Oh, we'll try, believe me.
Yes?
Why, yes. If the owners don't claim the dog in forty-eight hours, then you can apply for adoption.
You really want to ?
It's not diffcult.
EOD68
References? People we know?
Is that it?
Yes. We had a cat when I was eight years old. I love cats.
Umfortunately,no.
We also lide to know your reasons for wanting an animal.
To have a friend-a pal. You know, man's best friend is his dog.
That's me.
Uh-oh.
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.
Thanks again. Bye.
Her eyes look so sad. She must really miss them.
We are.
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.
I keep thinking about the dog-about Gemma, alone in the animal shelter.
I know they are. I mean about her being alone. Even if they are kind to Gemma, she's still alone, without her family
Are you ready, Alexandra?
I will have a cheeseourger, medium rare, with raw onion, and French fries, please.
A diet cola, please.
I've got it. Thanks.
No, I'm not.
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system when the dog scratched on the front door.Let's finish eating, and then we'll go back to my house. I want you to hear my new tapes. I've got some areat new dance music.
Hello. Is Robbie Stewart there?
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by to pick up the dog. The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs. I'm suer there's one for you. Thanks, Robbie. And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.
The owners clairned Gemma?
I'm glad for the dog.
Come on .Let's dance.
EOD69
Like what special matters?
Yes?
Yes?
Who's the patient?
Well, I'll try to arrange th schedule, Dr. Stewart. But it's not going to be easy.
Well, Mrs. Herrera, Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.
Well, It's a very easy operation, Carl. You won't feel a thing.
This Friday.
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera, but I don't want to put it off too long.
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?
She has a special way with kids.
Carl, does your throat hurt?
OK. Do you want to get better?
OK. We want you to get better, too. You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow, and you won't get so many colds anymore.
I know. It's a problem, isn't it? Let me try to work something out.
I have to think about it.
Oh, I'm not, Carl. Give me a chance to think about it, and I'll come up with something.
Maybe. But you just put on your pajamas and robe, and I'll think of a surprise.
No. There are other boys and girls here, and they're having their tonsils out. You'll meet them.
Change your clothes, Carl. Everything will be just fine.
EOD70
Frank, you've never played charades?
Carl, you're sure you've never played? OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank. We're going to play charades. Frank, you can learn as we go. And, Carl, you join in at anytime. OK, let me think. OK, I've got one .All right.
Right. A movie. OK.
That's easy. I can play.
Six words.
Sounds like.
You got that part right. Yes.
Sounds like what?
Absolutely right, Frank. Sounds like no. OK. We've got a movie. Six words. The first word sounds like no.
Go.
Show. That's It-show.
Snow.
This is fun.
The fifth word.
Seven?
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Carl, now you know charades. Why don't join us?
Oh, I like it
You're a sore loser.
No arguing. Save your voices. Between now and tomorrow you're all going to have your tonsils out. And you won't be able to speak for a while. So save your voices till then.
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart. This is a rough group.
Why don't you want to play?
Why not?
But you can have on when you go home, Carl.
I'm sorry, Carl.
But it won't be on my birthday! And you promised me a surprise.
EOD71
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me. Only one day, and it won't hurt as much. Do you feel like eating? Having some dinner? Oh, don't look so sad. Let me tell you about your dinner. It's ice cream
Strawberry?
Vanilla, too?
OK, honey, we'll see to it that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream. Just rest now. You need some rest to help you get better quickly. Hi Frank. How you doing?
Chocolate?
Three scoops?
You want three scoops also?
Well, I see you're feeling better.
I know it hurts. But it'll be better tomorrow. In the meantime, what would you like?
A surprise? I promised you a surprise, didn't I? And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?
Well, maybe, just maybe, there will be a surprise. But first you have to smile. I just want to see one smile from you.
How you all doing? Well, I'm glad you're feeling better because we have a little surprise for you today. It's Carl's birthday, and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you. And here he is -- Popo the Clown.
Hmm?
EOD72
Dad.
I thought you might be hungry. I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.
Ten 0'clock. What are you working on?
Can't you finish it tomorrow?
What's it about?
And...how do you feel?
I felt the same way.
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up. Well, don't work all night.
Well, maybe you should think about becoming a writer.
That's the worst part-making decisions.
Good night, Dad.
Ah, good morning Robbie.
How's my grandson?
Better than that. Tell him Philip.
Who's Charley Rafer?
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.
Great!
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie. I studied medicine there. Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.
Let's meet with Charley at the university club. Ten 0'clock tomorrow morning. It doesn't mean you're going Michigan.
In that case, it's OK. Dad, growing up means making my own decisions, doesn't it?
And then make your own decision.
I know it's sudden, Robbie, but this is an important opportunity. We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning. OK?
I want you to know something, Son. I'm...very proud of you.
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital. I'll see you all at dinnertime.
Is something still wrong, Robbie?
Going away to college for the first time always makes one a little nervous.
EOD73
Neither can I.
Yes, I have, Dad.
I came to the conclusion.
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks for hearing me out. And...
And thanks for being such an understanding father.
Philip Stewart! It's great to see you!
You must be Robbie.
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie. Robbie, I want you to meet one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team-Charley Rafer.
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?
Frankly, neither was I. Charley was the star of the team.
Oh, working too hard.
Fine, thank you. And how's Marge?
Can you have lunch with us later?
I understand. Well, thanks. I'll wait outside. Good luck, Son.
Yes, sir. Right here.
I see under "activities" that you've been writing for the school paper.
What kinds of articles have you written?
Hmmm. Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism.
You seem to have some reservations.
It's been very nice talking to you.
One piece of advice. The most important thing is for you to decided your own future.
Good-bye. Robbie. Good luck.
EOD74
Really? What did they say? Will you get into the school?
Columbia's a terrific school. What are you going to do?
You sound excited about Columbia. What's your problem, Mike?
The interview was fine.
It is. My father would like me to go there. He and my Grandpa both went there.
I know.
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.
I've been thinking. I think I want to study journalism to be a reporter-a newspaperman.
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.
No. But I have to.
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine. I was just waiting for your to get home so we could talk.
There is, Dad.
We want you to go to college, Robbie.
But?
Columbia? Why Columbia?
They do. And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?
Yes?
Dean Rafer called me today. He told me he was very impressed with you.
He told me you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.
That's OK.
Let me tell you something, Robbie. Something that might be surprising to you.
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him. Well, I wasn't clear about my future, but I knew engineering was not for me.
The truth.
I'm not upset at all. I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.
You're a real Stewart!
Never know what?
Robbie, you're something! You know, when I was your age, said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
