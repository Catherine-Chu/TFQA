Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street, in Riverdale?
Is there a station near here?
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt park. Thank you.
Thank you.
Is this pink too bright for me?
But I wear size ten.
Let me try it on.
It's six 0'clock. Where's my husband? I was expecting him here at five forty-five.
I'll take this green sweater. I like the color on me, don't you?
I'm sorry I'm so late. I had a really bad day.
I know. I know.I'm really sorry. I left my bag of film on the ferry. I went back for it , but the ferry was gone. I lost a whole day's work.
I didn't think of that. Thanks.
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.
Thanks,anyway. There was a girl on the ferry. Now maybe...
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.Don't worry. She'll be fine. You're welcome. Good-bye.
I'm tired and hungry.
All right. Is...is Susan coming?
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner?
I hope its pasta.
Yes, it was delicious.
Oh, I forgot dessert.
Don't worry. We've got lots of ice cream.
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.
I'll have chocolate.
Uh, one scoop of coffee and one scoop of chocolate for me.
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls. a whole day's work. And good stuff,too.
Hello. Does Richard Stewart live here?
I'm Alexandra Pappas. How do you do? Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat. I found it.
Robbie! Who is it?
Alexandra!
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Um...Alexandra, let me introduce you. This is my wife Marilyn.
Oh yes. Richard told us all about you. It's nice to meet you.
How do you do?
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.
Yes. And you must be Susan.Hi.
I'm so glad you found the bag and took the time and trouble to return it.
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to call home?
Please,use the phone.
Alexandra's a high-school exchange student from Greece.
With a family in the Bronx.
Take it easy, Robbie.
Have some iced tea.
Please sit down, Alexandra.
At the Bronx High School of Science.
Biology and mathematics. Richard tells me you're a doctor.
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.
Thanks, no. I do have to go. It was nice meeting you all.
Maybe.
Good-bye.
No,thanks. The train is just up the street. It won't take me long at all.
Bye.
Good night.
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!
Good morning, Susan.
Ten 0'clock, telephone FAO Schwarz about the new twin baby dolls.
Telephone Mrs. Zaskey at the advertising agency.
Eleven 0'clock, approve the sketches for the toy spaceship.
Right here.
Yes, I did.
I think the kids'll love it.
Huh.
Well, at one o'clock you have a lunch appointment with Mr.Levine, the client from the Toytown Stores.
At Rossano's.
At four o'clock, you have a meeting with the production staff in the conference room.
Will do. At six you're meeting Mr.Ozawa.
They're in my office.
Right.
Come on, Sam...
Hmm. I can't remember.
What for?
I know, Sam. Maybe soon.
Oh, wait a minute. What's today' date?
It seems to me I scheduled something else.
I'm sure I did. Oh, well, I'll probably remember it later.
Hmm. It's probably nothing. OK, let's get started. Would you call Priscilla Smith at FAO Schwarz, please?
Thank you. Just put them on my desk.
Wonderful. That was fast.
What time is it, anyway? My watch stopped.
What time is my lunch date with Bill Levine.
Remind me to leave at twelve forty-five.
No, but I have a feeling it's going to be too late when I do remember.
I just solved the mystery.
You have some guests in the reception room.
Mr. Harry Bennett and his daughter.
Is he a client?
Well, He's here with his daughter to have lunch.
Yes, indeed. What are you going to do about your appointment with Mr.Levine?
Hi, Michelle. Hello, Harry. It's nice to see you again.
Hi, Susan. We have both been excited about seeing you and having lunch with you today. Michelle picked these flowers out for you.
We're going to go to lunch in a few minutes, honey.
OK. You go out and get a drink of water at the fountain.
Thank you.
I used to be that way when I was her age. Harry, if Michelle doesn't want to go, we don't have to.
Yes. But could you wait one minute? I have a call to make. Would you excuse me?
Right. Hello. Susan Stewart calling Mr. Levine, Susan Stewart. I find myself in an barrassing situation. I made another lunch date for today and forgot to enter it in my appointment book. Can you and I meet for drinks tomorrow? I'd really appreciate it... Yes...Thank you...Tomorrow at five o'clock at the Biltrnore. I'll see you then.
What do you recommend?
Susan, would you like the crab salad?
Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad, too?
We'll have three crab salads and a pitcher of lemonade.
We used to catch crabs.
We had a summer house on Fire island. Do you remember, Michelle?
Sometimes, at night, we would go down to the beach and catch crabs, remember?
Right. Well, I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade?
Michelle, can we have a talk?
I know you miss your mother.
Then why are you and Daddy spending so much time together?
I'm his friend.
Sometimes he's very sad.
Sometimes.
So, what were you two talking about?
Oh, it's a quarter to four, and I have a production meeting at four.
Harry, I'd love to , but I have work to do.
I know I should, but... well, there are too many things to do.
So did I.
So am I.
Harry! Michelle! Can you wait till I make a phone call?
Sam, this is Susan.
Fine.
I know. Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me. He knows everything about the production schedule, and he can answer any questions.
Don't tell anyone, but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow. I'll be back for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.
Thanks
I know. I like her.
We had a talk.
Life.
Ellen, I'd like your opinion
Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming we need to have our own place to live.
Well, what do you think about Richard and me looking for a small house or an apartmnt at this point in our lives?
Richard feels we need to find a small house.
What did you do ?
Did you find one?
Sounds like Richard.
When did you buy a house?
Where was the house?
It's funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we probably won't be able to afford a house right away, either.
Good idea.
Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house.
I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good idea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking.
Good.
Well, I'll tell Richard, and we'll go to see her. Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen? Do you think it's too long?
No. No train. Just the dress. But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.
Thanks, Ellen. And thanks for the advice about the house. I'll talk to Richard about it the minute the comes home.
I remember yuor parents' first house very well. It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.
Yes, and you were such a cute baby.
I've been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time, so It's my pleasure to help you find a house now.
But we'd like to find ut about the possibilities.
Really?
I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs.Stewart.
Oh, so you don't need something immediately?
And time passes so quickly.
With two bedrooms?
I haven't thought about living anywhere else. We've always lived in this area.
Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco. It's a lovely area, and it's only about an hour's rive from here. Here. I have a book with photos of some homes in that area. Now, let's see. Here. This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.
I do, too. I don't care for a ranch type.
It looks wonderful.
I like this house.
And the price is right. Would you like to go see it?
If some one doesn't buy it before then. But let's keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.
Here. This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.
It looks like the houses in Hollywood.
It's quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house?
Then why don't we go look at this house, too?
Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.
My pleasure. Give my best to your parents.
Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli, I'll give them your regards.
I do think you should go see the houses and talk to the bank. Here. Let me give you some information sheets abo the houses. They're both very good buys.
How do you do?
I'm Ralph Riley.
Pleased to meet you.
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
For a house.
We're planning to buy a house.
We are customers of the bank. As a matter of fact, my whole Family banks here.
Neither. We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.
I'm twenty-nine.
And, Mr. Stewat, what is your occupation?
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?
Did you bring any savings or salary information? Last year's tax forms?
OK. What...what kind of house did you have in mind?
Thank you. Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?
Payments over thirty years?
Do you think we can get a loan?
No.
Why is that necessary?
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.
Thank you.
Godd-bye. And hope to see you soon.
Take care.
It all sounded so easy until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.
And I don't think it's a good idea to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor. I don't feel right about it.
Now, tell me, what's the problem?
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.
Why don't you speak to Dad?
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book and be able to put more money down.
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.
We're in no great rush. It's true.
It has been a learning experience. That's true.
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you...
You know we'll be there for you.
Is that you, Susan?
Am I glad to see you!
How are things?
Well, you look good. What's Harry doing tonight?
The rest of our family went to the movies. So it's just you and me, Susan.
Oh, I feel the same way, Susan. I miss seeing you. But to tell the truth, next time I'd like to go into the city and meet you there, instead of you coming here.
Yeah, I do. I need to get out more. Well, I mean there's a lot to do around the house, and I love being here with the family, you know, but I'm restless. Since I retired, I've got extra time on my hands.
I think you do. Frankly, I'd like to use my brain a little more.
But at my age, I'm not looking for a full-time job. I'm retired. But I'm bored.
Let's go into the kitchen, and maybe can help me set the table.
I prepared lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with.
You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you? A job of some kind.
Sam, would you come in ,please?
That's not it. Please sit down.
I need your advice on a personal matter, but it's not about me.
It's about my grandfather.
It won't sound like a big deal, but it is. I had dinner with him Saturday, and he's very unhappy about not working.
He is, but there's so much energy and talent in the man ,and he doesn't get to use it.
Simply this. John Marchetta runs this company.
Right. John Marchetta Gave me my start here six years ago, when I first graduated from college. He gave me the chance to use my talents and made me feel more confident.
Or at least give him some advice.
I can always depend on you, Sam.
No, no. I'll do that. Thanks.
Fine, thank you, Mr. Marchetta. Except for my grandfather.
He needs to work. In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you. I know you're building a new factory, and I thought...may be...my grandfather is so experienced in the construction trade, he could be so valuable.
Really, Mr.Marchetta? Can I tell him that?
Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.
Susan has told me a great deal about you.She says you're quite a man.
That's always nice to hear, Mr.Marchetta.
That's music to my ears.
Yup. Forty-three years. Here's a brief description of forty three years of on-the-job training.
Thank you. Yup. Forty-three years. Half that time in my own construction company. Big jobs-factories, shopping malls. That kind of thing.
Yes. After my wife died, and I felt I should spend more time with my children and grandchildren. I live in Florida, and they lived in New York.
When I came here, I planned to take a few months off. Relax with the family and then look for some work. Put my experience on the line...but, unfortunately, there isn't any work for a retired person my age.
What's that?
I'd like to be a member. How much are the dues?
That fantastic, John!
I've got plenty of time.
Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?
I understand.
Welcome aboard, Malcolm!
I will, John. And again-thanks.
He's quite a man.
OK, Danny. I know you didn't expect to have me around, but I think I can be of some help to you.
I don't want to give you a final opinion without studying these building plans more carefully. But a simple solution might be to move the air-conditioning units instead of redesigning the entire system. It might be simpler and less expensive.
It all happened so quickly! I can't believe it!
He was more than helpful. He actually took me to meet his foreman.
I don't know how to thank you, Susan. You're a wonderful granddaughter.
I'll be at the construction site tomorrow. What are you doing tomorrow night?
How about a date with your grandfather? I owe you a good steak dinner.
I'll pick you up here at seven. Is that OK?
There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.
Max...Max...Max. Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy. My first grandchild.
Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard, and I guess he looks a lot like me. Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.
When are they coming?
Well, children usually referable their parents.
You really like Michelle, don't you?
And Harry, too?
Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh, my! Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute, and we must prepare this room.
Well, let's take everything to the living room. Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space. It's crowded in here.
Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?
Yes. Yes, sir. A great-grandchild. A great-grandson. Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.
One day, You'll have your own family, and I'll be proud to be part of it.
Well, that's because you're so much like us-wonderful!
No, just Max. I like that. No middle name. No middle initial.
And Max has your initials, Grandpa
Weight
Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces, and Richard was eight pounds three.
Eight pounds six. You were big, just like Max.
Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.
Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten. I wouldn't call that tall.
Mother
Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!
Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!
A real Stewart.
It's almost ten 0'clock. I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday, and work begins at eight in the morning for me. Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home. He's the sweetest little thing.
It's so good to have you home again...and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.
TLC-tender loving care. That's our motto.
It was so kind of them. Now Max has come into everyone's life.
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove. You know, it hung over my crib, too. And it hung over Robbie's crib.
Oh, that's not all. It hung over Susan's crib.
Oh, that's not all. It hung over Susan's crib.
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck. He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team. He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.
Yes, and replaces it with a new glove so the old one will be ready for a new member of the Stewart family
And so do I.
Thanks, Michelle.
Isn't this baby outfit adorable? With his name on it "Max." Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.
I'm glad you like it. Michelle Picked it out.
And Max is some boy.
Right!
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?
Could I?
Let's go.
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?
Thank you.
She's smart and sensitive for her age.
Susan's like a mother to Michelle. They have a good relationship. Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.
He's a little quiet.
How can anybody get a word in around here?
Oh, really?
They always were, and they always will be.
They've always got an opinion. Always got something to say.
He's quiet now.
He's really cute.
I remember now. We always whispered when Michelle was born.
I bet you were cute.
Not as cute as Max. He's like a little doll.
Let's get Marilyn. What do you do when he cries like that?
He's so little...so new. Let's call Marilyn.
You like living in New York, don't you?
I know what you mean. I'd like to live in the city, but living in New Jersey and the suburbs is better for Michelle. Trees, grass.
The truth is, I'd like to live in the city. Michelle's the right age. There are lots of things for her here.
Not just for young people. What about me? I've never been to the aquarium or Museum of Natural History. Have you?
I've been there several times. Twice with Michelle.
Well, perhaps, you'll help me select some of the great places. And perhaps, you'll join us?
Well, there we are .All set for lunch, Harry.
I can't wait to take a bite of the pumpernickel. It smells so delicious. Coming! Coming! Who is it?
Come in Michelle, and bring your friends along. We're on the fifth floor. Oh you're been here before
Oh, please, Harry. It's nothing. I'm not just doing it for Michelle. I'm doing it for you.
I'm doing it for us, Harry.
It's important for Michelle and me to get to know each other better. That's important for us.
What, Harry? What makes you feel good?
Well, Harry, that's because I do. I do care.
Of course, Harry. We'll finish the conversation when they go to the museum.
Oh, Daddy! We had such a good time at the aquarium. I saw a real shark. I could almost touch it.
Hi, Susan.
I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.
And this is Shirley and Nicole.
Come on in. Come on in, Mrs. Cooper on in, everybody.
Well, please sit down and tell us all about it during lunch.
I love tuna fish. Don't you , Audrey?
Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.
Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.
Can we test a new game for you, Susan?
Let us try it ! Don't you want to play? Nicole ? Shirley? Audrey?
That's us, Susan.
That's easy.
Chest-c-h-e-s-t.
Creep-c-r-e-e-p.
Sheet -s-h-e-e-t-sheet.
Cheese-c-h-e-e-s-e.
I think it's too easy.
Michelle!
Well, I like the game.
Oh, it was nice meeting all of you. I hope you have a wonderful time at the Museum of Natural History.
Bye.
Oh, OK. Thanks, Mr. Bennett. That'll be fine. And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.
Just slow. You helped save our company a lot of money. Bye-bye.
I am.
There's a conversation we have to finish.
It was about caring.
Yes, caring. I said that it makes me feel good that you care about Michelle.
And it makes me feel good that you care about me.
And it makes me feel good that you care about us.
It's OK, Susan. We had this part of the conversation before Michelle and her friends arrived. Now comes the good part.
Well, assume that if you care about Michelle and you care about me and you care abut us, that we can talk about us. I mean-you and me. Isn't that right?
What I'm trying to say...since this is so easy ...Here are ten letters that express my feelings for you.
You want a hint? It's two words.
Can't you figure it out? Seven letters... two words...that express the feeling that I feel for you in my heart.
Well? Does that mean you'll marry me?
Sit down, Susan. There's something I have to ask you. Susan, will you marry me?
Three things?
Well, that's easy. We talked about that earlier. We'll live in New York.
We'll do that immediately. What' the third thing?
Absolutely! But first things first. We have to go pick up Michelle.
What's this for?
Fast asleep.
What are the flowers for, Richard?
But our anniversary isn't until Saturday.
We're not?
If you had your choice of all the places in the world, where would you choose to spend our anniversary?
Perfect! You picked the right place.
You and I, Mrs. Stewart, are going to spend a second honeymoon at the Watermill Inn.
No buts.
Richard, isn't that too much to ask of your mother?
But... I'll miss him.
It does sound tempting. You're right. We're earned it.
How could I forget?
Well...
Well, OK. See if they have a room.
Hello. Is this the Old Country Inn? Yes. This is Richard Stewart. The desk clerk at the Watermill suggested your inn. Would you happen to have a room for two available this weekend? Something really nice. My wife and I are celebrating our fifth anniversary. Yes. I'll hold. He's checking. You do? Great! What is the daily rate? That's fine. Thank you. Yes, we'll be arriving by car about ten 0'clock Friday night. Stewart. S-t-e-w-a-r-t. Thank you. Done! You and I, Mrs. Stewart, are going to have a wonderful, romantic weekend!
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart. Well, it's small, but clean.
Have a nice stay.
How is the view?
Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning. Right now, we should clean up this room.
Why should you be sorry?
Stop blaming yourself. After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together. And I l love you. Isn't that enough?
It is special. Happy anniversary.
I want some breakfast. Let's call room service and order a mice breakfast, and then we'll figure out what to do today.
Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.
That's OK, honey. I love walking in the rain.
What's that?
Well, what do you want to do?
Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.
Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.
And I do feel bad about your mother having to take care of the baby all weekend.
OK.
Uh... I give up.
What is she calling about?
You're kidding?
Welcome to the Watermill Inn.
And when I got married.
My great-grandmother made that quilt when Teddy Roosevelt was President. In those day, when they made quilts, they cut patches from the old clothing of every member in the family os that each one would be a part of it.
Thank you for calling us.
We were very young.
We have a baby now.
A boy-Max.
Would a professional photographer be without a picture?
And very bright.
And very good-looking, like his mother.
You see, Richard? Max is welcome here.
If there's anything you need, please call me. I'll be in the front office all day.
Thank you.
Now, this is my idea of a good time. Let's see...Hotcakes and maple syrup, with scrambled eggs.
Homemade buttermilk biscuits.
Let's eat!
Honey, if there were any problems, she would call us.
You're right. Of course.
This food is heavenly, isn't it?
What do you want to do after breakfast?
In the rain?
The mailman just dropped some mail in our box Grandpa.
You were right, Grandpa. Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.
You won't believe it, Grandpa, but there's a letter here addressed to you, Mr.Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter.
I don't think so. The return name and address is Pete Waers, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton. You know him?
What does he say? Is he OK?
Sounds like fun. Fifty Years? Wow!
What kind of farm does he have?
Does he have a family?
How come he never got married?
He must have loved her very much.
And what happened?
Football players are always popular with the ladies.
Did he ever get over it?
Where is she today?
You think so?
I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa. What do you think the surprise will be?
Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?
Don't you think you ought to call Pete and tell him you're coming?
Hello. What can I do for you?
Check the hood?
Whereabouts are you headed?
I know it well. Pete Waters' lived around here almost as long as I have.
About fifteen minutes. There's a shortcut-is you know it.
Sure. You take the next left turn. You'll see a stop sign. Make a right at the stop sign. Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge. Then you'll see a big old red bam. That's the back of Pete Waters's place.
Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler, but it'll take you ten minutes longer.
Can't miss it.
Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cent. No charge for the cleanup. It's on the house.
Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change. Thee we go... will mae twenty. Thanks.
This must be Peteps barn.Turn right to the house. Hi.
Is this the Pete Waters farm?
I'm a friend of Pete's . I'm looking for the house.
Well, thanks.
Don't tell me. Please don't tell me. I recognize you...
I know it's Malcolm Stewart. You haven't changed much in fifty years.
Who am I, you old rascal? You don't recognize me, do you?
You look wonderful, Malcolm!
Really?
He's so funny. Always full of surprises, even fifty years later.
How's your family? Oh, I was sorry to hear about your wife having passed away.
And you're living with your children now? In New York? Pete wrote us and told us.
By the way, what do you think this big surprise is?
Hey, that must be Pete! Now we'll find out about the surprise.
Oh, pete, Pete! Oh, It's so good to see you!
I remember all of you. You haven't changed a bit.
Lillian Winters. We were together in the Thursday night drama society.
Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian. How's Donald?
Sorry to hear that, Lillian.
I would not have missed this get-together for the world!
You don't know what the surprise is yet? Come on! We'll tell you the big surprise.
Celebrate?
No.
Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.
Well, I am pouring this iced tea so that we can toast Lillian-and me.
Yes, I do. I have loved Lillian all these years, so I asked her to be Mrs.Pete.Waters.
I knew it! Congratulations!
It's wonderful!
You are full of surprises, Pete.
When is the wedding?
Wait till I tell my family about this!
What are you doing?
You think you've got what?
I think you have got it, Richard. Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic.
And Comegie Hall. And the others. I do have it all.
Now for the hard part.
Well, it won't be easy.
Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?
He said I should call him. He's the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company. He said they need a new book of photographs, and he really liked my concept.
Do you think I have enough to show him?
You're right. My Family Album, U.S.A. feels right. I'll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.
Is it too early to call Mr.Carlson?
His number is five, five, five, seven, five, three, two. Five, five, five, seven, five three, two. Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.
I'd like to make an appointment with him.
My name is Richard Stewart. He told me to call him about my project, Family Album, U.S.A.
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye. Well, it's done. Tomorrow morning at a publisher's office.
Good morning.
Please sit down, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.
Excuse me, Mr. Carlson, but Richard Stewart is here for his ten 0'clock appointment with you. OK. Thank you. Like I said, he'll be with you shortly.
Yes, Mr.Carlson. Yes, sir. He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.
Yes. In there. Good luck.
Hello, Mr.Carlson.
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Well, I'd describe it as a book which is a ... a portrait of the United States-the places, the people-mostly the people. The things they do, the ways they live, the placesd they visit, and the landmarks. A photographic journey.
I'm glad you like them.
But?
What's that, Mr. Carlson?
That is a great ieda.The performing arts centers and the street performances. I'll do it.
Are you serious?
A couple of weeks.
You won't be disappointed, Mr.Carlson. Thanks.
Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks. So if you like the street-performance photos, you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?
Two weeks. I said I could do it in two weeks, and I did it.
Monday morning. I'm going to show him the photos on Monday morning. I can't wait!
Yeah. I really did do a good job, didn't I? Hey, you know? There's still some film left on this roll, and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.
You.
You look great!
Wonderful!
Fabulous!
Terrific!
They get better and better.
This is sensational!
What a job! Good work, Richard!
Like them? They represent your best work.
Absolutely.
You do. You do. There's a book here, I'll have a contract and an advance payment waiting for you first thing in the morning.
And while you're here I would like to introduce you to your editor. And I want you to meet the people in the art department. I'll set up an appointment with the marketing
In about half an hour. Why?
I don't believe it!
Carter Boswell!
He's running for the school board. The election's next month.
Nothing. But he wants to cut the school budget!
Cutting the budget is fine, but he wants to do it by cutting all the cultural programs. No music, no dance, no concert, no stage presentations.
He says it's to save the taxpayers' money, and I think he believes that the taxpayers' will vote for him if he spends less on the cultural programs.
Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more and keep the cultural programs for our kids.
I know, but if Boswell wins he'll be an important decision maker on the school board, and he doesn't know anything about our children's education.
Nobody. That's the problem.
Oh, not if I can stop him!
I don't know. Maybe I'll run against him.
I'm serious, Philip. Why shouldn't I run?
Your mother is thinking of running for the school board.
Against Carter Boswell? Great!
I think a lot of people will vote for you against Boswell, Ellen. I'll vote for you.
Absolutely.
I think you can make a difference, Ellen. And in a short campaign you wouldn't need as much money. You know something, Ellen? Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice? I'm with you. You can make a difference.
Mr. Maxwell?
My name is Ellen Stewart.
I'd like your help.
I'm planning to run for the school board.
Yes.
Will you announce that I'm running?
Of course.
Because I care.
Well, I care about the children of our town. I don't want hem to grow up without cultural programs in our school.
I want our children to learn more than reading, writing, and airthmetic. I want to keep the after-school programs-the music, the concerts.
We are. The citizens of Riverdale, of course. I plan to get help from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.
You don't know me. I can't expect you to take my side a against Boswell. But I do nee some publicity so that the people of our town know that I'm running for office and that I car about our children.
Here are the fliers, hot of the press!
Right over there, Grandpa. You fold the fliers, Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.
Need another box?
Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. Or Mrs.Anderson? Thanks.
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart. "She cares." Oh, see you at the polls.
Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs.Burns? Thank you.
Everyone saw story in the Riverdale newspaper.
It helps enormously. Everybody in riverdale reads his paper.
Thanks to you, Richard, it's a good picture.
Hi, Dad.
May I...may I help?
I fold the fliers.
And I lick the envelopes.
What channel?
Five?
A lot of people will agree with him.
Too bad kids can't vote. It's our school, but we can't vote.
There are, Ellen. Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.
Boswell's a powerful speaker.
...my slogan is "I care". I care about people, not things, Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care. How was it?
Can I see it?
Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart, and I'm running for the open seat on the school board. My slogan is "I care". What does the word care mean?...I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.
Leave it to me.
What happened?
That's a brilliant idea, Richard!
We got our brains from you, Day.
Mom, you're going to win! I know it!
You're going to win. Trust me!
She's winning! Mom, you're winning!
It's too soon to know for certain.
More sports after this.
Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard and get some fresh air?
What happened?
You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.
You tried, Mom.
Only one hundred and twenty-one votes! I'm sorry, Mom.
Look, you've made a very strong impressing on our community. You'll have another chance next election.
Hello Mr.Maxwell.
Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell. I appreciate your kind words. I needed that.
You are?
Thank you-and good-bye.
You were right, Philip. I did make a difference in town.
It looks wrong.
Are they always that difficult to make?
At this rate, the wedding will take place tomorrow.
I'm worried, Philip. What if we can't tie the tie?
You'd better not make Harry any more nervous than he is. Don't worry.We'll figure a way.
Not so good, Grandpa. We can't get this bow tie tied. Nobody knows how to do it.Do you?
Well, you have your own tuxedo. How do you tie your bow tie?
I don't.
What do you mean?
A clip-on?
Yes, it's so easy. All you do is clip it around under your collar.
The tuxedo rental store. Do you think they're open?
I'll call and find out.
Thanks, Grandpa.
Poor Harry. I know the feeling. Wedding-day litters.
We're in luck. They're open. And they have lots of clip-on bow ties.
You'd better hurry, Robbie.
In two hours and fifteen minutes I'll be married to Susan.
Oh, you're a lucky guy, Harry. Susan is one of the best women you'll ever find. She's just like her grandma.
Ring? Ring? Oh my! What did I do with the rings? I put them in the pocket of my sports jacket.
Right. What did I do with the rings?
Oh, yeah. I remember now. You handed them to me. What did I do with them?
Oh, don't worry, Harry. They have to be here.
Oh, I forget. What time is it?
What about the rings?
No, NO, Robbie doesn't have them. He gave them to me to hold on to them because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them. I put them in my tuxedo-but in the lapel pocket. That's a relief. I was really worried.
You're right. You're right. You hold on to them so there won't be problem later.
All right!
Hey, leaving me?
Try to take it easy. It'll all be over in two hours.
The wedding ceremony will be over. You'll be husband and wife.
And now for...something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Something blue. My wristband. I wore it when I married your father.
I bought it in an antique shop when I was about eighteen years old. I saved it for my wedding day.
Yes, honey I did. Are we ever going to finish?
The wedding dress. And something blue.
Something old. Right. What's old?
Grandma's pearls! Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them. I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.
Saving them for today? Oh, you're a real Stewart! Marilyn
Lovely!
The veil. Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!
Doesn't it look jst right on Susan?
And when you both say, "I do," Harry will lift this veil over your head and kiss the bride.
When you said, "I do, " Marilyn, it suddenly became real.
Oh, that reminds me. If we don't get dressed, we won't be there to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.
You never looked better.
She's right. And that's dear little Max. Got to go and feed him.
Take off the veil, kick off your shoes, and sit down.
Richard's going to take some wedding pictures before the ceremony. So just relax.
Philip...Ellen.
How are you? How are you?
I think it's time for the wedding to begin.
OK, Jane. Start the music.
I do.
I do
I have them, Harry.
Excue me. Can you help me?
Where is 83 Wooster Street?
Thank you. To the comer and then a left?
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.
Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks, and 83 is to the right about two houses.
You're welcome.
Harry Bennett. Is this Susan?
Nice to meet you, Susan. Sorry I'm late. The traffic. The parking. I was lost.
Pleased to meet you.
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?
Do you know the phone number of the restaurant? I'd like to call home and leave the number with the baby-sitter.
May I use the Phone? Five five five...one seven two oh, Hello? Hi, Michelle. It's Daddy. Can I speak to Betty? I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant.... Hi, Betty. I'll be at five five five...seventeen twenty. OK. Thanks. See you later. Well, that's done. Shall we go ?
Have a nice evening.
Me, too. Have fun!
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome! How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Pleased to meet you.
I like it here.
A special place for special people.
Well! Nice restaurant.
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice. Harry, what would you like?
How about a Califomia chabis?
What would you like to eat?
No, it's OK. I"ll have the mee krob also. What is it?
May I bring you a salad?
I recommend rose-petal salad. Special for new friends.
Why not?
I hope you're hungry.
Well, I...
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.
I know you're a CPA.
And so...
Yes.
I know. How old is she?
That's a nice age. What's her name?
Do you have a picture of her?
Thank you.
I'll get the rest of the dinner. Excuse me.
What's the matter?
Oh no! Is it serious?
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle. And you didn't have a chance to eat.
No,no. Please, go ahead.
We'll make another. Please don't worry.
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.
What happened?
What's wrong?
So...what do you think of him?
Will you see him again?
This food is delicious.
You ordered enough for three or four people, but I'm not complaining. The food delicious.
Do you think it's...
I believe it. Even without looking.
How...?
Did you go home?
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.
Oh, she's fine. It was only a tummy ache.
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there since her mother died.
As a matter of fact...I am hungry.
Mmm,this is delicious!
I'm going to excuse myself. I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow. Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you.
Good night, Susan.
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.She is sleeping here so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.
We are. The whole Stewart family is close.
And then, tww years ago, my wife died.
I do...yes, but I have Michelle...and with time...
No, not yet. What about you?
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy-I have an early start tomorrow, and the baby-sitter has to get home. Where did the time go? It's midnight. Thank you, Susan.I had a nice evening.
Yes?
Does that mean that I can see you again?
Wonderful. I'll call you, and we'll go out to dinner.
I promise I won't leave early.
You know something?
I think we're going to be good friends. Good night, Susan.
Sorry.
Where's Mom?
I don't know how she does it. She sure keeps busy.
I guess you're right. I wish I had her energy.
We're in here, Dad.
Hello, Philip. How was your day?
She went to a school-board meeting.
Oh?
Yeah. Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner. I came home a little while ago. You've been working late almost every night this week, Dad. Aren't you exhausted?
You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us in almost a full week.
I'm worried about you and Mom. You really have been working too hard.
You didn't finish it.
Well, I'm heading off for bed and a good night's sleep.
Good night, son. Good night, Dad. I'm going to bed.
Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?
OK.Good night.
Concerned about whom?
What do you propose to do about it? You have that look in your eye.
Hello there, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?
Reading? At this hour? Ah, come on, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?
Do you care to talk about them?
Robbie, Robbie, remember me? I'm your mother. If you have something you want to talk about, I'm always prepared to listen.
So that's it. OK, let's talk.
I thought you were proud of the work I do.
It's a real problem, Robbie. I know it.
Well, we always talk about taking a vacation together with the family.
It would be wonderful, but our schedules won't allow it.
You do?
What is it?
Yes.
Yes.
I don't get it.
Not bad. Not a bad idea, Robbie. As a matter of fact, it fits right in with something I'm working on right now with the school-board committee.
I've been trying to work out a program in the public school that will bring parents and teachers together once a week to read to the students-their own children, really. By doing that, it will encourage reading.
You're right. We'll do it! I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.
You are a very smart young man, Robbie. I think I'll wait until tomorrow.
Believe me, I won't. It is a great idea, and I promise you I won't forget.
Good morning. What a wonderful morning! Don't the flowers smell wonderful?
Did you find the sandwich I made for you?
Philip, I've been working on this special project with the school board, and I'd like your opinion about it.
Good luck!
Tell me about it. I work with families every day, Ellen. I see how people spend their leisure time-young and old.
I couldn't agree with you more.
I think you're going to give me the answer to tha question. You have that looking your eye.
Well, tell me about it.
In the home?
Hmm, interesting. But how do you plan to do that?
It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.
I guarantee you it would go very in the hospitals. My patients-mostly kids-would love to read and be read to.
I know so.
I love the idea. Would you work with me?
And that way, we'll spend more time together, Ellen. We just don't see each other anymore.
I have a question.
What do we read?
Yes.
Mrs. Stewart and I will read a poem by Robert Frost.
Would you begin, Ellen?
My little horse must think it queer.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
Grandpa!
We've been listening to you both. These are lucky kids.
Well, we may read together aloud at home.
I really like this one Susan. Do you?
I like the color. She looks good in blue.
Try on the skirt and blouse outfit, Michelle-the one that Daddy wanted you to wear.
Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married. She's never been happier.
We're very lucky, the three of us...and becoming part of the Stewart family, too.
Well...
Well...we...
It's my favorite outfit.
I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this. Do you want to see the winter jacket on me, Susan?
OK.
Is everything all right?
Let's take a look at the winter jacket. Come on over here, Honey.
It is. That's why we bought it for you. This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime when it's very cold out. But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong
I look silly! It is too small!
Can I take it off? I'm hot!
Well, are you going to tell me what's on you mind, Harry?
Los Angeles? That's a big decision.
Wow! It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Harry. If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.
That's wonderful, Harry.
What about the salary?
I understand, Harry.
Well, there's a lot think about. If it's a good job, then I've got to do some thinking about my career opportunities in Los Angeles.
Hello. Hello there. Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?
What's the matter, Susan?
Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?
Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.
Well, this something to think about.
Can I tell you what I think?
I think that you're very successful and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry. I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta, and I think he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles. He was very helpful to me, remember?
Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan. You know we'd all miss you. But this should be your decision. It's something that only you and Harry can work out.
In every marriage, sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.
Well, What do you think?
What does she think?
Well, you'll have to ask her.
Good idea.
Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.
She'll love it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.
The company is Craft and Craft, the biggest accounting company in the country.
The biggest.
Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.
As soon as possible.
Let me know by the end of the week. It's a great opportunity for you, Harry. Believe me.
Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.
I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.
And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?
That's exciting, Harry. What was it?
Aren't you excited about that?
I talked to Mr. Marchtta.
Of course, Harry. I want what's best for you, and I think I can get a good job through Mr. Marchetta inoios Amgeles also.
No, I'm not kidding. I talked with him, and he understands completely. He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles, and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.
But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.
And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?
Well, then you feel good about taking it?
I love my school. I have so many good friends there now. I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.
What's wrong, Susan?
I know. I heard you talking about it the other night when I was trying on my new clothes. It's about moving to Los Angeles.
Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...
But if you and Daddy wanted to, I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.
I'd miss them a lot, but I know what it feels like to miss someone.
Does Daddy want to move?
Well, how was everybody's day today?
Congratulations, Michelle! That's something! And how was your day, Susan?
I met with Bill York.
Really?
What about Michelle's school?
What about her new friends?
We're a family, Harry. Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.
We love you, Daddy.
OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York. Did you take the job?
What?
No, I did not take the job.
Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me...
No, no. I turned it down because of me.
Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle, and then I asked myself, do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?
And I don't. I went into business for myself because I like being my own boss. I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond. I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.
That's right, sweetheart.
I couldn't be more sure, Susan.
And besides, how could I live in Los Angeles when all my favorite people live here?
Who's that?
"Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top, When the wind blows. The cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, The cradle will fall, And down will come baby, Cradle and all."
Just sketching. I've been thinking a lot about our responsibilities in the past few weeks.
I've been wrestling with question of whether I go back to work or not.
And I'm torn. I really want to go back to work, use my talents, and pursue my career in fashion design like we as a fulltime mother, especially when he's a baby.
It's not the same, Richard.
Rita Mae called yesterday.
She wants to know when I think I'll be returning to the boutique.
I said I'd give her an answer in a few days...that I wasn't sure.
Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won't. Who knows? If I don't accept her offer, maybe she'll find someone else in the meantime, and when I'm ready to go back, there won't be a job for me.
But I am thinking about myself. Don't you see?
It's not just the job. It's also my career as Max's mother. That's the way I look at it. I have two career opportunities at the same time. My career as a fashion Designer and my career as a mother.
I hear Max.
There's your teddy bear, Max.
I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup. You should have seen the look on his face when Molly gave him the injection.
No, My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say, "Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"
I sure did. I held him closely. I kissed the top of his dear little head. He looked up at me. He tried to smile. Being with him helped.
Being a mother is not easy, if that's what you mean.
I'm sure you can, Ellen.
What did you do?
Do you think you made the right decision?
And you gave up your career as a music teacher?
How did you feel about being away when Susan and Richard were babies?
Well, we do too, Ellen. Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house we want and need.
Max thanks you. I thank you. And Ricard thanks you. Now may I please say hello?
Will you please try to relax? I've never seen you so wound up.
The truth is, I am. My job is not an easy one, but I really enjoy it.
What's the problem?
Well, my choice of careers.
My career as a fashion designer versus my career as a mother.
That's what I said.
Why can't you do both?
Both?
And that's what I did. I did both with Richard and Susan, and I did both with Robbie.
I did. But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher which I could continue at home.
I don't know why I didn't think of it. It seems so simple now.for a year or two I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.
Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.
I'm going to call rita Mae at home and ask her come by and talk about it. She want to see Max, anyway.
And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.
I'm going to call Rita Mae right now. Oh, Susan, thank you so much for coming all this way form the city to talk to me about it. I hope you don't mind having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.
I think you should call Rita Mae right now. I think your idea of working at home is perfect.
We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.
Hi, big guy.
She sure got here quickly. That's a good sign. She must like you and your work, Marilyn.
Hi, Marilyn.
Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.
I haven't seen you since the hospital.
We met at the hospital. Hello. How are you?
Oh, and there is Max! Oh! My, how he's grown! A little present for Max.
It's nothing. It's just a little present for Max.
Oh, nothing, thank you.
It's nice seeing you. Let me know if you need anything.
Thanks, Ellen.
I have made a decision, Rita Mae. I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.
But I haven't finished telling you the other half of my decision.
Yes. I think I can stay at home and take care of Max and continue my career.
Do you remember our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?
Why can't I design dresses for you here at home? And make them here. Have the fittings here, too.
Exactly.
I've thought about that for some time.
Wedding dresses.
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.
Do you really mean it?
I'm so excited! I can't wait to tell Richard!
It all sounds so easy.
Would you like to see some of my designs that I've been working on?
Morning, Grandpa. Is something the matter, Grandpa?
Is it tat serious a problem, Grandpa?
But there's the old community center on Elm Street.
I never realized that.
I see what you mean.
It could be Alexandra. She's coming over this morning to help me with my math.
Hi, Alexandra. Come on in. Do you want something cold to drink?
Cola coming up. I really appreciate you coming over to help with my math. My final exam is next Tuesday.
Hi, Alexandra.
I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell. Don't let me interrupt you.
He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons, Mr. Stewart.
Really, Grandpa?
But you had to be good at math. You graduated from engineering school.
Then there's hope for Robbie.
You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie, if you skip it now.
Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker.
Where?
I remember now. Right. Hi. Hello, Alexandra.
Stay...stay.
Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm?
It's a serious matter for a lot of us. A serious matter.
Thanks. Nice to meet you...again.
There is a way, Malcolm. We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.
That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.If you would supervise the refurbishing, I'll find the people to help do it.
I'll help.
Can we help?
Sure.
I'll do it. I'll talk to them.
Come in, come in. Please, come in.
Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.
And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe. He ran the drugstore and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.
Hello, Mr. Stewart.
Hello, Malcolm.
Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra? Weren't they going to be here this morning?
It's OK. I'm sure they meant well, but they probably had other things on their minds.
I was, indeed.
When can I do that? I'd be happy to.
That's fine with me. I can do it either day.
I think the building just needs a good cleaning.
Then we have to furnish it.
Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime, let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.
Go ahead, Janne.
This place can be developed with one real intergenerational program.
And programs that don't leave anyone out.
If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late. But Alexandra and I have been busy at work this morning on the community-center project.And we brought someone along who can help. You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa? He's the editor of the Riverdale paper. He wrote some nice articles on Mom when she was running for the school board.
Hi, Mr. Stewart. Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project. From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me, you people are making one big story.
Robbie and Alexandra told me what you need to fix up the old library. I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.
OK. Now, I have...first...a couple of questions here. Have you talked to the community council? And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?
People power. Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.
To help scrub the building interior clean.
And you also need bodies to do repainting?
When do you need the volunteers, and where do they report?
How about furnishings? Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?
Let's see. Four desks. Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs. Six table lamps. Three end tables .One piano. This is a good start. These items shouldn't be difficult to come by once I print the article in the paper. This community has always been very generous.
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed, we need to put together volunteers from the various generations of future users.
And without their energy and stamina, there's no way we can complete this project.
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area...
Hi, Mom.
Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall ready for the graduation ceremony, so we all got to go home early. Too noisy to study.
Mom, give me a break Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final.
Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner?
Thanks, Mom.
Yes. I like her.She's a terrific person. I'm going to miss her when she goes back to Greece.
Mom, that would be terrific! Maybe we could make it a surprise.
Well, we could tell her it's a graduation party for me. When Alexandra arrives, we'll surprise her.
I'd like to give her a nice going-away present.
There's only one problem.
I'm broke. I should have saved some money.
I know. But, well, I'd like to give her something nice to remember me by. Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad.
Thanks, Mom. I'll talk to him. Is he still in his office?
Thanks, Mom.
Here are the X-rays you wanted , Dr. Stewart.
What do you think?
Thank you.
Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you?
Can we talk?
I need some help.
Well, before I go to college, I have the whole summer...
And I'm planning to get a job for the summer.
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.
Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it. But right now, I'm kind of short of cash.
And my friend Alexandra is going to Greece...
Mom says we can her a going-away surprise party.
And I'd like to get her a nice gift...
Well, a wristwatch, so she'll think of me when she looks at the time. Nothing flashy or expensive. Something simple-but a good one.
Well, I saw a nice watch. But I'll need a loan. If you could lend me the money, I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary.
Would tomorrow be OK?
Thanks, Dad.
Yes?
Could I?
I will. Thanks, Dad.
You're OK, Dad.
You ready for the next problem?
Sure.
Sunday. Why?
Yes. I should be finished packing by then.
Terrific!
That isn't necessary.
Oh, well, that would be very nice.
Eight 0'clock is fine.
Who's going to be there?
I'm going to miss all of you. You've been like a second family to me.
Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?
Wonderful! Are you excited about graduating from high school?
Scared? Why?
I was when I first came to the United States. I'd never been away from home, and I didn't know what it would be like. But then I found out that people are the same everywhere once you get to know them.
Thatnk you. I'm glad I got to know You-and your family.
It would be very nice. But that isn't the way it works. So...back to work.
Good night, Alexandra.Will you be all right?
Good night, Alexandra. I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?
I have to run.
Yeah.
Am I going to miss her?
I'm going to miss her, and my math teacher's going to miss her.
It's not the same.
Great! Pass me the hammer.
You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?
Millie, did you bring the papes for dancing?
What did you bring?
Perfect! Alexandra will love it! I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.
My mom's decorating it right now.
How about some music?
Did she say why she had to leave today?
This is terrible.
Why is he blowing his horn like that?
Do you think we should take down the decorations? They'll just make him sad.
Hi, How'd it go?
Yeah? What was it?
Alexandra!
I called my parents from the airport. When I told them my friends were giving me a party, they insisted that I stay. So now I'm taking a flight on Monday instead.
But how did you know the party was for you?
Oh, it's so pretty!
All right! Now we can really start the party!
Hear, hear!
We should thank you. You're a real friend!
Thank you.
OK. I can't believe it!
You had it engraved!
"In friendship, always. Alexandra." I knew we thought alike, but this is too much! Thank you.
Miss Pappas?
Mrs. Stewart, may I have this dance?
Hot dogs. I love hot dogs. There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country.
Cooked outdoors over an open fire. I wish I had one now.
Oh, I sure do.
I might as well take it along. And now to make sure we've got the hamburger patties. I have to remember to put them in the bag tomorrow morning before we leave.
Mom, we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend and giving up your free time.
I guess Max is asleep by now. He's not crying anymore.
Well, he's asleep-finally. I feel so bad for him. It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth.
Well, he wakes up several times during the night, and the pain is so bad.
Please don't worry, Marilyn. Remember your father-in-law's a pediatrician. We have a live-in doctor if there's a problem I can't handle.
I'll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again.
I"ll try it.
They're coming by at six tomorrow morning, so we can get an early start.
And a full night. Tomorrow night we'll be camping out in tents.
We'll be heading back late in the afternoon.
We'll have a great time camping out, I'm sure. But I'm still a little worried about you, Ellen.
He's asleep. I think he'll sleep through the night now.
Well, so do I. Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip. We need to bring a flashlight.
Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn?
No. And we're bring the ketchup, mustard, relish-all that stuff. And cooking utensils. Well, here's the bottle poener, and here's the flashlight.
Matches?
And don't forget your camera and film, Richard.
And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes. Some music tapes and some blank tapes so that we can record our thoughts about the trip.
That's what I thought.
Oh, I love it! To be away from the city on such a beautiful day is my idea of heaven! The grass. The trees. The fresh air.
You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan. Wait till you see yourself jumping around.
Come on, Richard. Help me get this stuff out of the car.
Well, we'll put everything over there. We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods. Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe.
That's what makes this spot so good.
I am.
When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry. Aren't you hungry, Marilyn?
Starving.
Aren't you hungry, Harry?
Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?
Well, how do you like it so far?
Me, Neither.
Oh, You're right. I wish we had brought Max.
Richard is right. Are you having a good time, Susan? You haven't answered my question.
Good.
Thanks, Susan. I thought you'd all like it.
I've always liked camping out. Away from the telephones and account books. It's refreshing for me. I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.
I'm glad you like it, Susan. We'll spend many more weekends like this.
And next time we'll bring Michelle.
I can hardly keep my eyes open. If only we could bottle the fresh air.
We could call it "Deep Sleep Country Air."
Too bad we can't bottle the sound.
Can what?
What are you talking about?
I'm so glad everyone is asleep. I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be a wake.
I'm sure everything is fine. My mother knows all there is to know about taking care of babies, I assure you.
Welcome home-and I do mean welcome home.
Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard. Believe me, Max is fine. But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.
Oh, I feel so bad.
We had a great time, Mom.
It was nice here, too.
Oh, yes. Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon. I went to the supermarket to get a few things, and I stayed out an extra half hour. The village was filled people-the weather was so nice.
Come on. You all helped.
Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.
Lots of special country things. We picked flowers.
They smell wonderful.
It would be a great business if you could do that.
Uh, we're home now, Ellen. We'll take care of it.
What's that?
Well, all your things are inside. There's your sleeping bag.
Say good-bye to Richard. We'll call you all tomorrow night.
Bye, Mom.
Bye.
Max has stopped crying.
It works!
This.
Like Max did.
A little further to the right, Tom.
Good. What do you think ,Richard?
It's the first thing people will see when they come in. It sets the tone for the whole show. The next thing they'll see is this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A.
You've earned it. Years of work went into these pictures.
Well, remember, we're not sure what the critics are going to write about your show yet. And you never know what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it.
I always worry. The reviews of this show are important for the sales of your book.
Soon. One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview. I hope he's in a good mood.
The book will be a success. And the show will help promote it.
It's common practice.
A lot of people come to openings just so they can get the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday.
A little further back, Tom. It's too close to the refreshments.
You may be right. Try it there, Tom
Nervous about the opening tonight?
How about guests? How many people will you be bringing?
No such thing as" too many" at an opening.
Your family or the pubic?
I'm sure they'll like it.
Mitchell, so nice of you to come. Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson. Mitchell is one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country.
I'm afraid so.
Nict to meet you, Mr. Johnson.
Well...you mind if I look around and see what it says to me?
Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh.
It probably means he's clearing his throat. I don't know.
Thank you, Tom.
Oh, really? I'd like to see your work.
Oh, I'd still like to see your work. You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it.
I do mean it.
Thank you. I hope that's a compliment.
Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell?
Favorably?
I have an autographed one in my office. Tom, would you give Mr.Johnson the copy of Richard's book on my desk?
Sure.
Do you like the dress?
I designed it myself.
Are you ready? We're supposed to be there before the guests arrive.
But this is what you've been working for all these years.
Well, it's all part of the same job. Just relax and enjoy it.
What are you afraid of?
You're going to be a great success. Are you ready?
Let me help. Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.
Thank you. Well, I suppose I'v run out of excuses.
Oh, one minute. Before we go to the gallery, I just want to tell you that I never could have done this book without your help and your love. I appreciate it.
What is it?
Of course not, Richard. Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.
Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight!
Charmed.
My mother, Ellen Stewart. Harvey Carlson.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.
Hi.
And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.
And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.
No, thank you.
I do. I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr.Carlson.
Thank you.
Yes?
Not yet. The newpapers don't come out till about ten 0'clock. When they come out, we'll get it.
Ready?
What's this?
I can't. Would you read it, Marilyn?
Congratulations!
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention for a moment, please? I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition. I know that I am. And I would like to introduce the young man who spent the last five years taking these remarkable pictures and writing the background for Family. Album, U.S.A-Mr Richard Stewart.
Oh, I'm glad this's over.
Oh, not at all.
Our pleasure. Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.
Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Oh, well, really...
What's this about, Harvey?
Of course. I've seen you on television.
Well, that sounds very exciting, but where would I fit into the plan?
Oh, Richard, how exciting!
Hold on. Wait a minute, please.
The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor. I like what I do. In fact, I love what I do...which is going out with a camera and a roll of film and seeing the wonder of humanity. Now, I appreciate your offer, but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A. and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject. I'm flattered, but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that. Thank you, but I'm happy being a photographer.
Richard, I know your next book will be a success. Congratulations!
You're a real Stewart!
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?
I am so excited! At this time tomorrow morning, Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.
At six 0'clock this evening.
No, by train.
Not Grandpa. He doesn't want anybody picking him up. He likes to be independent.
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.
Good morning, Mom.
Well, hi,fellas.
Hi,honey.
Morning, Marilyn.
I'm really excited about seeing Granpa.
He's so funny. He always makes me laugh. I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.
Won't he miss being in Florida?
Are you sure about that? It's crazy here most of the time.
That's for sure.
That's a neat idea. What can I do ? I've got it! I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet. It's from the Fathers and Son's Breakfast at my junior high school graduation.
I'd really lik to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.
He's something!
That's it. But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.
I don't know. It's locked.
Oh, hi, darling.
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet. You know I'm very exceted about his arrival.
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too. He loves Susan.She always reminds him of Grandma. Well,how's everything here?
It's locked.
Excuse me .Is this seat taken?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
No, no,no. I like the aisle seat better. Please, you sit by the window.
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?
No,no.I'm from Florida.
No,no.I just chaged my seat. A man next to me was smoking, and smoke really brothers me .Where are yuo from in Florida?
Small world. I'm form Titusville,too.
My husband and I live near Spaceport.
Oh yes, yes.My husband's there now. He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me. Do you still live there?
Are you married?
I'm sorry.Really, I'm sorry.
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.
He's an aerospace engineer and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.He started with them almost forty years ago. What do you do?
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket,please.
It's OK, lady. Take your time.
Oh,here it is.
Thank you.
No, no.But do have very close friends in New York City. We like to go to the theater togther. You said you have family in New York.
You must be excited.
Are you going to live with them?
Permanently?
I understand. But tell me. Why did you stop working?
Ladies and gentiemen, Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City. The train will be stopping in five Minutes. Please check to be sure you have your belonings. And have a good stay in the Big Apple. Thankyou.
And nice meeting you,too.Mrs.Tobin. Please look us up. We're in the phone book. Dr.Philip Stewart, in Riverdale.
That's right. And have a good time in New York.
When can we go fishing?
I'm ready, Grandpa.You name the day.
Presents-for me?
And this one's form me .I looked all over the house to find it.
I sure do. It was fun.
She feels bad, too, Grandpa. She called to say the plane was delayed. You know airports.
Don't you want something to eat?
Well, come on, Dad. Ellen and I'll take you to your room.
Good night, Grandpa.
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk?
I sent the wrong key. I have something for you. I made it my self. I think you'll enjy it .I researched it for over a year.It's our family tree.
Fabulous! Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.
Thank you so much.
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter. Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.
I know you will.
I'm exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard.
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.
My instructor thought that the beginner's class was too easy for me.
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class, they give you a chance to rest between exercises.
The advanced class is nonstop.
Listen, Richard, doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.
You think so?
Tomorrow morning at ten 0'clock. Try it.
Aren't you going to the aetobics class this morning?
You are not going to be able to move afer this and the aerobics class.
Yeah. What's the bet?
The bet is-I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family. Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.
OK. Call my instructor, Jcak Davis, right now. His number is 555-8842.The advanced class starts at ten 0'clock advanced class starts at ten o'clcok.
It onl takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class. Give him a call.
Jack Davis, please.
Hello. This is RIchard Stewart. My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program. I'd like to come to the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.
Thanks. I'm on my way over.
Bye-bye. It's all set. I'm going.
See you later.
OK, Richard. That's terrific. Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine. Now stand up,please. Good, it's 122 over 80. You can sit down now. When was your last complete physical?
Good.Do you have any back or knee problems?
What do you do for a living, Mr.Stewart?
Interesting. What do you photograph?
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?
But don't you think it'd be a goo subject?
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr.Stewart Maybe you can photograph a class, and I can give you and Mrs.Stewart a month of classes-free.
Anytime.
Terrific!
Oh, hi.
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines. We're going to take it slow first. Stretch up...and we're going to go left first...2,3,4...now stretch...OK,hold to the right. Sunrises.Stretch it out. Flat back.Bring it up...and twists...and side...2,3...and left...push...push...turn...hit the floor. Take it side again...OK, and switch. Stretch it out .And we're going to warm down with a tango.Left, Right. Enjoy it.
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.
Nothing. I am in excellent health. I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.In other words, I'm in wondeful condition.
And your legs don't hurt?
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this. And they don't hurt-not even a little?
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me .That's six steaks.
Seven steaks.Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy. The shopping
Yes, Richard.
I knew it!
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?
And you didn't exercise?
There's another advanced class today at four 0'clock. We'll go together.
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.
Including Susan. Four 0'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.
Skip, hop, front, Twist...again...OK,Now...scissors.
Yeah.Just wait.
OK. Let's pick up the pace.
I can barely move.
OK, Finish off by jogging in place. OK. Keep those knees up. All right.That's it for today. Thank you, everyone. See you next week.
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move.
Excuse me, Richard,Marilyn.
Thanks. But I have a question. Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?
You are in great shape, Richard. Very few people last in this class for the full hour the very first time.
Thanks!
Hi, Grandpa.
Can I help?
How about some bacon?
Dad and I were planning to go to the game, but he has to work today, and my friends don't wan to go . It's not an important game, anyway.
I'll work on my computer. I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.
Anytime.It's really easy, but, like anything, you need to work at it, Grandpa.This bacon is great. I love crispy bacon.
Nothing much.
I'd like that, but...
But Dad is always so busy.
Sure,I can.
I really feel bad about it, but they need me at the hospital today, in the children's ward.
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.
I sure do...Well, I've got to run, Dad. See you later.
I'm thinking about it...So,how's work?
You're working pretty hard these days.
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?
Remember our fishing trips?
Remember catching your first fish?
Yes,we did. Maybe we should do it again.
Don't you have to work?
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled. I am, too, Son.
Tomorrow.It'll be like old times for you and me. And Robbie will love it.
Radio says sunny and mild.
This is really neat! When do we eat?
How do you know so much about fishing?
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.
I just saw a big one!
Hi.
Albert.
Yes,sir.
I'm ten.
He's up there at the lodge.
Yes, sir.
I'll watch him, Dad.
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.
No way! We're here to catch our lunch.
That's right. I forgot! The right magic. Do it for Robbie,Dad.
Sure. Come on.
Fish, fish, send me a fish...I got one!
It's a big one!
Grandpa, get the net ,please!
You bet I have!
Sorry,Dad.
You didn't say the magic words.
Yes,but you did, and we've got our lunch. Let's build a fire and cook it ! Come on ,Albert, you can help us!
All right, but be careful.
I think so. I hope you like,your fish well done.
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in.
He's not breathing, Philip!
Yes,Dad.
Breathe,Albert!
I hope so. That's it. That's the way. That's it. There. Oh, it's going to be all right. That's it. Wrap him in the blanket. Dad! That's it. That's it. It's all right, Albert. You're going to be OK.
We'll take you to him. Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.
I know, Grandpa.
He's asleep. He's ging to be fine.
Thank my son Robbie. He pulled him out of the water.
Dad saved him, not me.
So long.
That's great idea. Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital. I have to get to a phone. It probably means we can't stay.
One of my patients has a hight fever, and I have to go to the hospital. I'm sorry, Robbie. I guess I ruined your day.
Why are you back so early?
He had an emergency.
No, Mom. We had a great time.
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look! They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.
We had a good day. Robbie pulled a boy out of the water.
I know.
Hello,Dad.
How about a cup of coffee ,Son?
How was the patient?
Was it serious?
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.
Now I know.
Me,too.
How about next Saturday?
I'm changing my schedule. Well, do we have a date?
I have other plans, Robbie. But I think you two can have a good time together without me.
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee. We should get to work, or we won't be finished by dinnertime.
We must.
Come on, Philip! Get busy with your famous apple pie. There's much mre to be done.
What goes into my apple pie besides apples? Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.Butter, nice and cold and hard. OK, here are the walnuts. Last but not least, the reason my apple pie is famous-cinnamon. Cinnamon...Ellen, where's the cinnamon?
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder,cinnamon. Ellen?
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?
Good morning.
Good morning. Robbie. Can you do me a favor?
The apples?
Cinnamon!
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open. I'll get some for you.
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie. It's cold outside.
OK.
Hello...Hello,Alexandra.How are you?... Fine. Robbie just went to the store.He'll be back sonn. He said he'll call you... Oh, oh, I see... Oh... certainly.Well, do you have the phone number there?...Oh... I see...Please, I know he wants to talk to you...Thank you, and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too. Try to come by later for dessert... Bye.That was Alexandra. She and the Molinas are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.She doesn't have the phone number.
He'll be grouchy. Maybe she'll call back. She promised.
Or did you forget to give it to me?
I'll call her back.
You should have your breakfast, Son. Make you feel better. Protein, vitamins.
Yes, she did.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
He missed a phone call.
Yes, Alexandra.
I love parades. The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun. Look at that Superman balloon! Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.Don't you just love it? Oh, and the bands and the music. John Philip Sousa. I love his music. Da dadas da da dada da da da da da dada. Oh,look at that float, Robbie.Look at those funny-looking clowns.
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.Remember when you and your dad and I went to the Thanksgiving Day parade? You were Four or five years
Hello, Susan. Yes, I know, but he'll get over it . Good. Then you'll be here about five? Oh, fine. I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle. Drive carefully. Good-bye.
I'm not surprised. It's Grandma's recipe.
What about my famous apple pie?
How's the parade?
Mom! Is it for me?
Who was it?
Can I help with anything?
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma.
Four.
I'll be back to see the game.
Let me think. He graduated from medical school in 1960 and from the University of Michigan in 1956.
Yup. I graduated in 1937.
OK, everybody. I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle to Thanksgiving with us.
Call me Philip.
But first, I think we should take a moment and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?
I will. I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well, so I can enjoy you all.
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job, and for meeting Harry and Michelle.
I love you, Daddy.
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us. And I'd also like to thank my math teacher for giving me a passing grade. And call me , Alexandra.
She'll call.
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.It's not finished yet. And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for. For the food on this table. Just like th Pilgrims.
Well, help me serve, Robbie.
And now to see the end of the football game.
Where are you going, Philip?
Did you forget something?
Just let me see the score, Ellen.
Oh, who could that be? Oh, it must be Alexandra. I invited her to come by for dessert.
I like Ellen.
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.
Hi.
Hi, Marilyn.Hi, Susa... Happy Thanksgiving.
Please sit down, Alexandra. Dad, Richard-Alexandra's here.
Hello, Alexandra, Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown. One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.
How'd you guess?
We forgot to trun the over on .
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.
Sure, Ellen.
Just wouderful, Mr. Stewart. The Molinas are a large family. I love being with them.
I am, too.
Great Thanksgiving. Lots to be thankful for. Michigan scored a touchdown. Alexandra came by . And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful.
They're so thoughtful. You are very lucky, Robbie, To have such a nice family.
No, nothing.
I don't know. Something's wrong.
I received a letter from my partents this morning.
No.
I miss them. I miss them very much.
The Mollnas treat me so nicely, and I love being with you family so much... but when I received the letter with photographs of my family, I cried. I cried because I miss them all.
Yes.I know I must seem silly. It's not like I have nobody. I Like the Molinas very much, and they're so kind to me.
That's a good idea. But if we go out, please don't complain about your math teacher or your math homework. I want to have fun.
I have to turn off the lights, or else my father will get really angry. He says I never turn them out when I leave. If they come home and they're on...
Yes. What was that?
It sounded like a dog barking right here.
A dog!
Oh,you poor little thing. Come here.
Poor baby.
Her name's Gemma, and she belongs to Mr.and Mrs.Levinson. There's a phone number-five five five...eight four four eight. Robbie, maybe you should call them and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.
The number you ae calling-555-8448-is no longer in service.
Oh, you poor, poor baby. You've lost your family.
Don't worry, Alexandra. We'll find the owner.
Let me think.
With a little help from the ASPCA, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They're the ones.We once found a cat. She was caught in the branches of our tree.And Dad called the ASPCA.They came and solved the
Let me see-ASPCA....Here it is.ASPCA Animal Shelter. 555-7700.
Hello,my name is Robbie Stewart. I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you. How late are you open?
Thank you. I'll bring the dog over by nine.

They're open until nine 0'clock. We have two and a half hours. Let's take Gemma by there now. They'll find the owner.
I'm sure they'll find the owner . But if they don't, I'll adopt her. She's so cute. Look at those eyes. She's hard to resist .Don't you just love her?

Robbie Stewart. And this is Alexandra Pappas.
46Linden Street, Riverdale.
She found us.
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.
There's no other information.
You will try to find the dog's owner.
And if you don't?
If you don't... can I...can I adopt the dog?
How do I do that?
Yes. I'm serious. If no one comes to claim Gemma, I'd like to adopt her.
OK. If you want to adopt an animal, first we need to know some references.
Friends, teachers... We need to talk to some people about you We want to be sure that you're responsible and that you can take good care of an animal. Then you have to till out this form about your family background.
No, there's more. We need to know about your history with animals. Have you ever owned an animal?
Do you have any animals now?
Anything else?
Just to hold it and cuddle with it. Just to have as a pet I love animals.
And one thing more. If you're under twenty-one years of age...
Then an adult must sign for you.
No problem.My parents will think it's a good idea. I'll be back with them.
After forty-eight huors. But please call first.
It's my pleasure. Nice talking to both of you.
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.
I see you're both animal lovers
Good-bye, Miss Aborn. We'll call in a couple of days.
Bye.
I know. But I promse you, Alexandra, the dog is just fine.They're very kind to the animals.
Ready, folks?
Yes, I'm ready. I'll have the chefs salad, please.
Anything to drink?

Aren't you surprised that the animal shelter is so careful about finding homes for the animals?

That's right.
I guess I am , too. She said if I come by, She'll help me fine another dog.
Molly, I need your special talent for handing special maters.
Well, I have a scheduling problem.
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule. And...I know you can do it.
Carl Herrera. The boy has infected tonsils, and we should remove them as soon as possible.
I know you'll be able to take care of it.
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart. He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.
But when do they do it?
But Saturday's my birthday.
No, I think it's important to do it now. We can have a birthday party for you, Carl, when you come out of the hospital.
Come with me, Carl. You and I will talk this over.
She sure does.
Yes.
Yes.
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow, I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.
What?
You're fooling me .
A surprise?
Will it hurt?
I don't want to.
OK. Do you know how to play charades?
Nope.

Six words. It has six words.

I got it!
I don't like charades. It's for babies.
Well, they're babies.
Yeah.
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody. Well, what's going on?
I didn't want to play charades, so they're angry at me.
Because I don't want to be here. I don't want my tonsils out.
Because my birthday is tomorrow. My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.
But my birthday is tomorrow.
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home.
It hurts, doesn't it?
Ice cream. All kinds of flavors. Chocolate.
Vanilla?
I see you're feeling better already, Betty. So you will have dinner?
Oh, come on now. You're a big boy. It doesn't hurt that much, does it? Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much, and won't be able to have dinner. You're just going to have to have ice cream. Yes, Ice cream. Lots of flavors. Want to hear them?
Then chocolate it is. One scoop or two?

Surprise.
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?
No smile, no surprise . That's the deal. No smile, no surprise. If you want a surprise, then you've got to smile first.

No, I have to turn it in in the morning.
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.
Me? A little scared. And excited, too.
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.
I don't mind. I enjoy writing.
Maybe I should.
You'll be OK. Good night, Son.
"Hail to the victors valiant, Hail to the conquering heroes, Hail, Hail to Michigan, The champions of the West!"
Good morning, Dad.
Fine, Grandpa. Fine! What's all the cheering about Did the University f Michigan another football game?
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.
He's the Dean of Admission for the University of Michigan.
We were both on the tennis team.
It is great. He's going to be in New York tomorrow to interview applicants for admission.
But I may not want to go to Michigan.
I know that, but...
Not exactly.
Yes, I know that.
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor. But the interview will be good experience for you.
You're right, Robbie. But, like your Grandpa suggested, have the interview.
That sounds fine.
Sure, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
Bye, Dad.
I'll be OK.
Sorry, Robbie. Sorry to be late this morning, but, well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee. I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.
So you thought about it, huh?
Well, I'm glad. I knew you'd realize that this interview could be an important experience for you.
That's very wise, Robbie. Very wise. Now let's head off for the city and the university club.
Thanks...for what?
And...?
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.
Charley Rafer-you look as young as ever.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.
No, I'm not very good at it.
Yeah. Thanks. Well, how've you been, Philip?
Doesn't show. How's Ellen?
She's still giving the toughest English history exams in the school and loving every minute of it. And speaking of minutes, I have interviews until noon, so why don't we get right to work?
I'd love to , Philip, but I'm afraid I can't. I'm only here two days, and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.
Did you bring your transcript from high school?
Thank you. Please sit down.
Yes, sir.
All kinds-sports, editorials, theater reviews. You name it, I've written it.
A professional writer? Not until recently.
Yes, I know that.
I'm a little uncertain.
Nice talking to you, sir.
Yes, sir. Good-bye. Dean Rafer.
I had an interview today, too. I had a great interview with Admissions at Columbia University.
Well, they didn't say anything for sure. But I figure that with my grades and with my personality, I'll have no problem.
Do? I don't know. I also applied to NYU.
Indecision. Indecision. It's not easy, and this is an important decision we have to make. What about you? How as your interview with Michigan?
It's a great college.
Great medical school, too.
You can follow in your father's footsteps.
What do you want to study?
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.
Have you discussed it with your parents?
OK. Let's talk.
Anything special you want to talk about?
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot to save money for my college tuition.
I know. I do.
Well, I've Thought a lot about which college, and one of them is Columbia.
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.
That's only part of it. It's complicated. I'll try to explain. Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.
Well, we talked about a lot of thing .He applied to Columbia, and his interview was very successful. He thinks he'll be accepted, and he really wants to go there.
He's a nice man. He was very kind.
Yes. I do. I'm just not sure about what I want to do.
You understand?
What? Tell me.
What did you tell Grandpa?
Then you're not upset about my not wantin to go into medicine?
I am too, Dad.
Yes, but I also wanted to apply to several other colleges.
Well, I might want to go to Columbia. But I might not. I just want to be able to make my own decision.
And if I think about it long enough, you never know...
If I make my own decision, I might choose Michigan.
